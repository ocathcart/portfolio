# Linked list and iterators

## When to use linked nodes:

Linked storage: - unknown list size (no need to resize by copying)

        - If memory is a huge issue though and time is not a problem at all…

    - Many insertions and deletions needed within (rather than at the end)

        - If one does not have direct access to the positions though…

    - Most operations need traversal of the list from the first element

Contiguous Storage: - Known number of elements (no need for links) - Few insertions and deletions needed within (no shuffling) - Lots of searches on a sorted list (can use binary search, which is faster) - Access to elements by their positions (constant time)

# Motivating iterators

![double_list](/static/images/FIT1008/double_list.jpg)

Implementation:

```py
def double(self) -> None:
    current = self.head
    for _ in range(len(self)):
        new_node = Node(current.item)
        new_node.link = current.link
        current.link = new_node
        current = new_node.link
    self.length *= 2
```

# Implementing iterators

We need a way of creating an iterator object to start the iterations:

    - An object *other than the list* because:

        - It needs to change (move through the list) without changing the list
        - We might need several iterators on a list

    - In Python, iterator objects are returned by method `__iter__`

This means we need an iterator _class_ to create the objects:

    - Its __init__ performs the “beginning-of-iteration” initialisation

        - In our example: it makes sure we start from 3

The class needs a way of returning the _next_ element:

    - In our example, first 3, then 7, then 13, and then StopIteration
    - In Python, this is implemented by the `__next__` method

## How do we make the LinkList class iterable?

We need to create an iterator class for the list:

    - A class with the `__init__`, `__iter__` and `__next__` methods

```py
class LinkedListIterator(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, node: Node[T]) -> None:
        self.current = node

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self) -> T:
```

Implementing `__next__`

![__next__](static/images/FIT1008/__next__.jpg)

```py
def __next__(self) -> T:
    if self.current is not None:
        item = self.current.item
        self.current = self.current.link
        return item
    else:
        raise StopIteration
```

or

```py
def __next__(self) -> T:
    try:
        item = self.current.item
    except AttributeError:
        raise StopIteration
    else:
        self.current = self.current.link
        return item
```

# A modifying iterator

We started this to be able to define the function double(a_list)

    - And do so from outside the class

Can we now do that? What do we need?

    - To traverse the list and add new nodes as we do so

Can our iterator add nodes?:
So we need to create a different kind of iterator:

    - One that allows us to modify the iterable object

Additional operations we will define: - _delete:_ returns the item pointed by current and deletes the node - _add:_ adds an item right before current (to do in the pracs) - _has_next:_ returns True if there is a next item to be processed (i.e., if current is
not at the end of list) - peek: returns the next item (the one pointed by current) without moving along.
Raises StopIteration if there is no next.
Since we need to add and delete: - We are going to need not only a current but also a _previous_ - Plus some times we will need to change the head of the list
• We are also going to keep the list itself

```py
class LinkListIterator(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, a_list: LinkList[T]) -> None:
        self.list = a_list
        self.previous = None
        self.current = a_list.head

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self) -> T:
        if self.current is not None:
            item = self.current.item
            self.previous = self.current
            self.current = self.current.link
            return item
        else:
            raise StopIteration
```

Implementing `has_next`:

```py
def has_next(self):
    return self.current is not None
```

Implementing delete:

```py
def delete(self) -> T:
    if not self.has_next(): # we reached the end
            raise StopIteration("no more elements in list")
    else:
        item = self.current.item
        self.current = self.current.link
        if self.previous is None: #it is the first element
            self.list.head = self.current
        else: #not the first element
            self.previous.link = self.current
        self.list.length -= 1
        return item
```

# Basics of Higher Order Functions in Python

Being a first-class object means being like any other object:

    - *Functions* can then be *assigned* to variablesnext
    - *Passed* as arguments to a function/method
    - *Returned* by a function/method

A _higher order function_ is one that:

    - *Takes* another function as argument and/or
    - *Returns* another function as argument

In Python functions (and thus methods) are first class objects

    - So you can define higher order functions

# Linked Stacks

Stacks = last in first out (LIFO principle)

remember Abstrack stack class:

```py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import TypeVar, Generic
T = TypeVar('T')

class Stack(ABC, Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.length = 0

    @abstractmethod
    def push(self, item: T) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def pop(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def peek(self) -> T:
        pass

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return self.length

    def clear(self):
        self.length = 0

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self) == 0

    @abstractmethod
    def is_full(self) -> bool:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def __toString__(self) -> str:
        pass
```

Class for linked Stacks:

```py
from typing import TypeVar
from abstract_stack import Stack
from node import Node
T = TypeVar('T')

class LinkStack(Stack[T]): # no fixed size
    def __init__(self):
        Stack.__init__(self)
        self.top = None

    def is_full(self):
        return False

    def clear(self):
        Stack.clear()
        self.top = None
```

# Push method for Linked Stacks

Push: Algorithm

In the _array_ implementation: - If the array is full: raise exception (or resize, if we wanted to do that) - Else:

        - Add the item in the position marked by top (was the same as the length of the list)
        - Increase top

In a _linked_ data structure:

    - Create a new node that contains the item
    - We link it to the current top
     Make the new node the new top

No need for `is_full` check
If no more memory can be allocated:

    - The system will raise an *exception*

Basically:

- Create a new node for item
- Link it to the current top node
- Make the new node the new top

```py
def push(self, item: T):
    new_node = Node(item)
    new_node.link = self.top
    self.top = new_node
    self.length += 1
```

# Pop method for linked stacks

Pop: Algorithm

Array implementation: - If it is empty: raise exception - Else: - Remember the top item - Decrease top - Return the item
Linked nodes: - Almost identical - We simply move top along, rather than increase it

Basic:

- Check if the stack is empty
- Remember the item in the top node
- Make the next node the new top
- Return the item

```py
# O(1)
def pop(self) -> T:
    if not self.is_empty():
        item = self.top.item
        self.top = self.top.link
        self.length -= 1
        return item
    else:
        raise ValueError("Stack is empty")
```

## Advantages/disadvantages of stacks

Main advantages:

    - Good to *resize*:

        - Push: never full so no need to copy, just add element at top
        - Pop: uses less memory when elements are popped

    - Needs *less space* than the array, *if the array is relatively empty* (less than half)

Main disadvantage:

    - Needs *more space* (for the links) than the array, if the array is relatively full

Other disadvantages:

    - A bit *slower*

        - Still constant time but a bigger constant (create nodes, etc)

Implementing `reverse`:

```py
def reverse(string: str) -> str:
    my_stack = ArrayStack(len(string)) / LickedStack()

    for char in string:
        my_stack.push(char)

    output = ""

    while not my_stack.is_empty():
        char = my_stack.pop()
        output += char

    return output
```

# Linked Queues

Remember Quese ADT:

```py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import TypeVar, Generic
T = TypeVar('T')
class Queue(ABC, Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.length = 0
    @abstractmethod
    def append(self, item: T) -> None:
        pass
    @abstractmethod
    def serve(self) -> None:
        pass
    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return self.length
    def clear(self):
        self.length = 0
    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self) == 0
    @abstractmethod
    def is_full(self) -> bool:
        pass
```

Class for linked Queses:

```py
from typing import TypeVar
from abstract_queue import Queue
from node import Node
T = TypeVar('T')

class LinkQueue(Queue[T]):
    def __init__(self):
        Queue.__init__(self)
        self.front = None
        self.rear = None

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return self.front is None

    def is_full(self) -> bool:
        return False

    def clear(self) -> None:
        Queue.clear()
        self.front = None
        self.rear = None
```

# Linked Queue append

Append: algorithm

Linear array implementation:

    - If it is full: raise exception
    - Else:

        - Increase rear
        - Add item at position marked by rear

In a linked list:

    - Create a new node that contains item and points to None
    - Link the current rear to it
    - Make the new node the new rear

Again, no need for `is_full` check

Basic:

- Create a new node for item
- Make a link from the current rear to the new node
- The new node becomes the new rear

implementing `append`:

```py
# O(1)
def append(self, item: T) -> None:
    new_node = Node(item) # create new node
    if self.is_empty():
        self.front = new_node # move head
    else:
        self.rear.link = new_node #link it in
    self.rear = new_node # move rear to new node
    self.length += 1
```

# Linked Queues Serve

Serve: algorithm

Linear array implementation:

    - If it is empty: raise exception
    - Else:

        - Remember item to return
        - Increase front
        - Return item

In a linked list

    - Almost identical
    - We simply move front along rather than increase it

Basic:

- Remember the item in the front node
- Make the next node the new front
  -Return the item

implemnting `serve`:

```py
# O(1)
def serve(self) -> T:
    if not self.is_empty():
        item = self.front.item # store the item to serve
        self.front = self.front.link # move front
        self.length -= 1
        if self.is_empty(): # if now empty
            self.rear = None # move rear
        return item
    else:
        raise ValueError("Queue is empty")

```
