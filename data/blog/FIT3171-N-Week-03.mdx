# The Relational Database Model

## The Relational Model

- Introduced by CODD in 1970 - the fundamental basis for the relational DBMS
- Basic structure is the mathematical concept of a RELATION mapped to the
  'concept' of a table (tabular representation of relation) - Relation - abstract object - Table - pictorial representation - Storage structure - "real thing" - eg. isam file of 1's and 0's

- Relational Model Terminology
  - DOMAIN - set of atomic (indivisible) values
  - Examples (name, data type, data format):
    - customer_number domain - 5 character string of the form xxxdd
    - name domain - 20 character string
    - address domain - 30 character string containing street, town & postcode
    - credit_limit domain - money in the range $1,000 to $99,999

## A relation

- A relation consists of two parts
  - heading
  - body
- **Relation Heading**
  - Also called Relational **Schema** consists of a fixed set of attributes
    - R (A1,A2,.......An)
      - R = relation name, Ai = attribute i
  - Each attribute corresponds to one underlying domain:
    - Customer relation heading:
      - CUSTOMER (custno, custname, custadd, custcredlimit)
        - dom(custno) = customer_number
        - dom(custname) = name
        - dom(custadd) = address
        - dom(custcredlimit) = credit_limit

## | CUSTNO | CUSTNAME | CUSTADD | CUSTCREDITLIMIT |

## Relational body

- **relational body**

  - Also called Relation Instance (state of the relation at any point in time)

    - r(R) = {t1, t2, t3, ...., tm}
    - consists of a time-varying set of n-tuples

      - Relation R consists of tuples t1, t2, t3 .. tm
      - m = number of tuples = **relation cardinality**

    - each n-tuple is an ordered list of n values
    - t = < v1, v2, ....., vn>
      - n = number of values in tuple (no of attributes) = **relation degree**

  - In the tabular representation:
    - Relation heading ⇨ column headings
    - Relation body ⇨ set of data rows

## | custno | custname | custadd | custcredlimit |

| SMI13 | SMITH | Wide Rd, Clayton, 3168 | 2000 |
| JON44 | JONES | Narrow St, Clayton, 3168 | 10000 |
| BRO23 | BROWN | Here Rd, Clayton, 3168 | 10000 |

## Relation Properties

- **No duplicate tuples** - by definition sets do not contain duplicate elements - hence tuples must be unique -** Tuples are unordered within a relation** - by definition sets are not ordered - hence tuples can only be accessed by content
- **No ordering of attributes within a tuple**
  - by definition sets are not ordered

## Relation Properties cont'd

- **Tuple values are atomic** - cannot be divided

  - EMPLOYEE (eid, ename, departno, dependants)
    - not allowed: dependants (dep_name, dep_age) multivalued
  - hence no multivalued (repeating) attributes allowed, called the first
    normal form rule

- COMPARE with tabular representation - normally nothing to prevent duplicate rows - rows are ordered - columns are ordered
  - tables and relations are not the same 'thing'

## Functional Dependancy

- Functional Dependency:
  - A set of attributes A functionally determines an attribute B if, and only if, for
    each A value, there is exactly one value of B in the relation. It is denoted as A - B (A determines B, or B depends on A) - orderno → orderdate - prodno → proddesc - orderno, prodno → qtyordered

## Relational Model Keys

- A **superkey** of a relation R is an attribute or set of attributes which exhibits only
  the uniqueness property - No two tuples of R have the same value for the superkey (Uniqueness
  property) - t1[superkey] ≠ t2[superkey]

- A **candidate key (CK)** of a relation R is an attribute or set of attributes which
  exhibits the following properties: - Uniqueness property (as above), and
- No proper subset of CK has the uniqueness property
  (Minimality or Irreducibility property) ie. a minimal superkey
- One candidate key is chosen to be the primary key (PK) of a relation. Remaining
  candidate keys are termed alternate keys (AK).

## Selection of a Primary key

- A primary key must be chosen considering the data that may be added to
  the table in the future - Names, dates of birth etc are rarely unique and as such are not a good
  option - PK should be free of 'extra' semantic meaning and security compliant,
  preferably a single attribute, preferably numeric (see Table 5.3 Coronel &
  Morris) - Natural vs Surrogate primary key - ENROLMENT (unitcode, student_id, enrol_sem, enrol_year,
  enrol_mark, enrol_grade) - Superkey - CK - PK - Issues with PK?

## Null in the Relational Model Implementation

- NULL is a concept created and implemented by SQL, does not exist in classical
  relational algebra
- NULL is NOT a value - is a representation of the fact that there is NO VALUE
- Reasons for a NULL:
  - VALUE NOT APPLICABLE -
    - EMP relation - empno, deptno, salary, commission
      - commission only applies to staff in sales dept
  - VALUE UNKNOWN -
    - Joe's salary is NULL, Joe's salary is currently unknown
  - VALUE DOES NOT EXIST -
    - Tax File Number - is applicable to all employees but Joe may not have a number at
      this time
  - VALUE UNDEFINED -
    - Certain items explicitly undefined eg. divide by zero
      - Columns Number_of_payments, Total_payments
      - Column Average_payment_made
      - If Number_of_payments = 0 => Average undefined

## Writing Relations

- Relations may be represented using the following notation:
  - RELATION_NAME (attribute1, attribute2,…)
- Relation_name must not be pluralised (is a set name)
- The primary key is underlined.

- Example:
  - STAFF (staff_id, staff_surname, staff_initials, staff_address,
    staff_phone)

## Relational Database

- A relational database is a collection of normalised relations.
- Normalisation is part of the design phase of the database
  and will be discussed next week.

Example relational database:

**ORDER (order_id, order_date)
ORDER_LINE (order_id, prod_id, ol_quantity)
PRODUCT (prod_id, prod_desc, prod_uprice)**

## Foreign Key (FK) - Implementation

- FK: An attribute/s in a relation that exists in the same, or another relation
  as a Primary Key.
- Referential Integrity
  - A Foreign Key value must either match the full primary key in
    a relation or be NULL.
- The pairing of PK and FK creates relationships (logical connections)
  between tables when implemented in a RDBMS. Hence the abstraction
  away from the underlying storage model.

## Data Integrity - Implementation

- Entity integrity
  - Primary key value must not be NULL.
    - No duplicate tuple property then ensures that each primary key
      must be unique
    - Implemented in the RDBMS via a unique index on the PK
- Referential integrity
  - The values of FK must either match a value of a full PK in the
    related relation or be NULL.
- Column/Domain integrity
  - All values in a given column must come from the same domain
    (the same data type and range).

## Relational DMLs

- Relational Calculus
- Relational Algebra
- Transform Oriented Languages (e.g. SQL)
- Graphical Languages
- Exhibit the “closure” property - queries on relations produce
  relations

## Relational Calculus

- Based on mathematical logic.
- Non-procedural.
- Primarily of theoretical importance.
- May be used as a yardstick for measuring the power of
  other relational languages (“relational completeness”).
- Operators may be applied to any number of relations.

# Relational Algebra

## Relational Algebra

- Relationally complete.
- Procedural.
- Operators only apply to at most two relations at a time.
- 8 basic operations:
  - single relation: selection, projection
  - two relations:
    - cartesian product, join
    - union
    - intersection
    - difference
    - division
    - Standard/pure RA form has no concept of NULL (Database unit uses standard RA)

## Relational Operation PROJECT

**PRDETAIL (project_code, project_manager, project_bid_price)**

## JOIN

- Join operator used to combine data from two or more
  relations, based on a common attribute or attributes.
- For conventional relational algebra, different types of joins
  are: - theta-join - equi-join - natural join

## THETA JOIN (Generalised join)

**(Relation_1) ⨝F (Relation_2)**

- F is a predicate (i.e. truth-valued function) which is of the
  form Relation_1.ai θ Relation2.bi - CUSTOMER.cust_no θ ORDER.cust_no
- θ is one of the standard arithmetic comparison operators,
  < ≤ = ≥ >
- Most commonly, θ is equals (=), but can be any of the
  operators - EMPLOYEE.emp_sal > SALARYSCALE.step_5

## NATURAL JOIN
