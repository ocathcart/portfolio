# mutability

**mutatability** refers the the ability to change and alter an object.

list are **mutable** while strings are **immutable**.

example:

```py

fruit = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]
print(fruit)

fruit[0] = "pear"
fruit[-1] = "orange"
print(fruit)

```

list can be altered and spliced

```py

alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
alist[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
print(alist)

#we can aslo remove elemtnts

alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
alist[1:3] = []
print(alist)

# and insert new elements

alist = ['a', 'd', 'f']
alist[1:1] = ['b', 'c']
print(alist)
alist[4:4] = ['e']
print(alist)

```

## strings are immutable

this means that strings can't simply have their elements changed by a simple function

```py

greeting = "Hello, world!"
greeting[0] = 'J'            # ERROR!
print(greeting)

#they can be changed through

greeting = "Hello, world!"
newGreeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
print(newGreeting)
print(greeting)

```

if you choose the strings it can be come messier then it would if you just had a string.

```py

phrase = "many moons"
phrase_expanded = phrase + " and many stars"
phrase_larger = phrase_expanded + " litter"
phrase_complete = "M" + phrase_larger[1:] + " the night sky."
excited_phrase_complete = phrase_complete[:-1] + "!"

```

## tuples are immutable

tuples are also immutable

```py

fruit = ("banana", "apple", "cherry")
print(fruit)

fruit[0] = "pear"
fruit[-1] = "orange"
print(fruit)

```

## List element deleteion

example of deletion in list

```py

a = ['one', 'two', 'three']
del a[1]
print(a)

alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
del alist[1:5]
print(alist)

```

# objects and refrences

to see whether two names have the same value we use the "is" function.

```py

a = "banana"
b = "banana"

print(a is b)

# this will return the true if a and b share the same value.

```

what python does when we ask for the 'is' function, python checks the id's of both values to see if they mathematical.

we can manually check this with the 'id' function

```py

a = "banana"
b = "banana"

print(id(a))
print(id(b))

```

however this only happens because strings are immutable,

this situation is diffrent for list.

```py

a = [81,82,83]
b = [81,82,83]

print(a is b)

print(a == b)

print(id(a))
print(id(b))

```

## aliasing

idk, list are like mutable but because their mutable, when they share the same values they aren't the same object because they can be changed without creating a copy. because of this if we make b = a and a is equal to a list, then they are the same object, so in this case a 'is' fucntion would return true

## creating clone lists.

this is how we go about creating a clone of a list, as if we change the list, we also have an original

```py

a = [81,82,83]

b = a[:]       # make a clone using slice
print(a == b)
print(a is b)

b[0] = 5

print(a)
print(b)

```

## mutating methods

some mutating methods

```py

mylist = []
mylist.append(5)
mylist.append(27)
mylist.append(3)
mylist.append(12)
print(mylist)

mylist.insert(1, 12)
print(mylist)
print(mylist.count(12))

print(mylist.index(3))
print(mylist.count(5))

mylist.reverse()
print(mylist)

mylist.sort()
print(mylist)

mylist.remove(5)
print(mylist)

lastitem = mylist.pop()
print(lastitem)
print(mylist)

###########################################

mylist = []
mylist.append(5)
mylist.append(27)
mylist.append(3)
mylist.append(12)
print(mylist)

newList = mylist.sort()   #probably an error (fixed by changing the new sorted list to have a diffrent object name)
print(mylist)

```

## applied vs concantenate

i don't even know

## deep and shallow copies

assuming you dont want a coppied list that can be altered by changing the values of the original list. you can do a nested iteration which can be visualised as such:

```py

original = [['dogs', 'puppies'], ['cats', "kittens"]]
copied_outer_list = [] #creates new list
for inner_list in original:
    copied_inner_list = []
    for item in inner_list:
        copied_inner_list.append(item) # the for loops cycles through the elements in the list and append them to the new list creating a copy that isnt directly affected by the original
    copied_outer_list.append(copied_inner_list)
print(copied_outer_list)
original[0].append(["canines"])
print(original)
print("-------- Now look at the copied version -----------")
print(copied_outer_list)

```

you can also take advantage of the slicing operation to create a new independant list:

```py

original = [['dogs', 'puppies'], ['cats', "kittens"]]
copied_outer_list = []
for inner_list in original:
    copied_inner_list = inner_list[:]
    copied_outer_list.append(copied_inner_list) #this creates an independant list that isnt effected by changes to the original
print(copied_outer_list)
original[0].append(["canines"])
print(original)
print("-------- Now look at the copied version -----------")
print(copied_outer_list)

```

if list have more then two levels it is reccomended that we import the module copy which has a function called **_deepcopy_**:

```py

import copy
original = [['canines', ['dogs', 'puppies']], ['felines', ['cats', 'kittens']]]
shallow_copy_version = original[:]
deeply_copied_version = copy.deepcopy(original)
original.append("Hi there")
original[0].append(["marsupials"])
print("-------- Original -----------")
print(original)
print("-------- deep copy -----------")
print(deeply_copied_version)
print("-------- shallow copy -----------")
print(shallow_copy_version)

```

## non-mutation methods on strings

there are a wide variety of methods for strings for example:

```py

ss = "Hello, World"
print(ss.upper())

tt = ss.lower()
print(tt)
print(ss)

```

# Week 6 Workshop

### implement deepcopy

```py

exampleList = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d'], ['e', 'f']]

def deepcopy_exactly_2(lst: list):
    loopValue = True
    newList = []

    while loopValue == True:
        for lists in lst:
            newListinner = []
            for elements in lists:
                newListinner.append(elements)
            newList.append(newListinner)
            if newList == lst:
                loopValue = False
            else:
                loopValue = True

    return newList

print(exampleList)
deepcopy_exactly_2(exampleList)

print(id(deepcopy_exactly_2(exampleList)))

print(id(exampleList))

#both list have diffrent id's

```
