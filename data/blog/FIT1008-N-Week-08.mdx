# Recursion

## Motivation behind Recursion

### Revision: recursive algorithms

- Solve a large problem by reducing it to one or more sub-problems that are:
  - Of the same kind as the original
  - Simpler to solve
- Each of the sub-problems is itself solved using the same algorithm …
  … until the sub problems are so “simple” that they can be solved without
  further reductions (base cases)

### Examples

- To find a route from A to B:
  - if they are “very close” (e.g., one step), easy to find (the one step); - else …
    - find a place C “between” A and B;
    - find a smaller route from A to C;
    - find a smaller route from C to B;
    - put the two routes together
- To wash up a pile of dirty dishes:
  - if there are no dishes in the pile, easy to do (stop); - else …
    - take one dish, wash it up, and then …
    - wash up the remaining pile of dirty dishes

### Candidate problems for recursion

1. Must be possible to decompose them into simpler similar problems
2. At some point, the problems must become so simple that can be solved
   without further decomposition
3. Once all subproblems are solved, the solution to the original problem
   can be computed by combining these solutions

### General recursive structure

- That of a function that calls itself (directly or via others):

```py
def solve(problem):
    if problem is simple:
        # Solve problem directly
    else:
        # Decompose problem into subproblems p1, p2,…
        solve(p1)
        solve(p2)
        solve(p3)
        …
        # Combine the subsolutions to solve problem
```

## Recursion example Factorials

### Example: factorials

- Determine the number of permutations of a given number of distinct
  elements
- For example: consider the letters
  - a b c d e
- How many permutations of these 5 letters can we make? - 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
  since there are 5 choices for the first letter, 4 for the second, 3 for the
  third, etc.

### Factorials: how do we program it?

- We assume n ≥ 0 and factorial of 0 = 1
- We start by looking at examples:

```
0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 1*2
3! = 1*2*3
4! = 1*2*3*4
…
n! = 1*2*3*4*…*(n-1)*n
```

### Factorial: an iterative approach

```py
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    result = 1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        result = result * i
    return result
```

- What is the value of result before and after each iteration if n=5?
  1*1;
  1*2;
  2*3;
  6*4;
  24\*5;

thus, it would correctly return result=120

### Factorials: what about recursively?

- We start by looking at examples:

```
0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 1*2
3! = 1*2*3
4! = 1*2*3*4
…
n! = 1*2*3*4*…*(n-1)*n
    (n-1)!

n! = (n-1)! * n
```

### Factorial: recursive approach

```py
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0: # base case
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1) # recursive call
```

What would the execution be like? Cascading calls

- 5 \* factorial(4)
  - 4 \* factorial(3)
    - 3 \* factorial(2)
      - 2 \* factorial(1)
        - 1 \* factorial(0)

### Recursive procedure/method

- Must have the following components:
  - At least one base case
  - At least one recursive call whose result is combined
  - Convergence to base case (must be “simpler”)
- In factorial:
  - if n==0:
  - factorial(n-1)and \*
  - (n-1)
- What happens if
  - no base case?
  - no convergence? (e.g., we code `n*factorial(n)`)

```py
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
```

## Iteration versus Recursion

![recursion4](/static/images/FIT1008/recursion04.jpg)

### Recursion versus iteration

- Can every iterative function be implemented using recursion?

  - Yes, it is straightforward
    - Iterations are replaced by function calls
    - The base case is the (negated) condition of the loop
  - Often needs an auxiliary function to prepare the converging arguments (see later)

- Can every recursive function be implemented using iteration?
  - Yes, BUT you might also need to store past results in either
    - Accumulators, or
    - A stack (recall how the run-time stack is also used to implement recursive functions)

### Example: from iteration to recursion

- Consider an iterative method in LinkList to compute the length, if the
  class did not have self.length:

```py
def __len__(self) -> int:
    current = self.head
    count = 0
    while current is not None:
        current = current.link
        count += 1
    return count
```

![recursion05](/static/images/FIT1008/recursion05.jpg)

### Example: from iteration to recursion

```py
def __len__(self) -> int:
    return self.len_aux(self.head)

def len_aux(self, current: Node) -> int:
    if current is None: # base case
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + self.len_aux(current.link)
```

## Recursion example Length

### Length: recursive approach

```py
def __len__(self) -> int:
    return self.len_aux(self.head)

def len_aux(self, current: Node) -> int:
    if current is None: # base case
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + self.len_aux(current.link)
```

## Recursion example Contains

### Another example: iteration to recursion

- Consider an iterative method in LinkList for checking if an item is in the
  linked list or not, again assuming we do not have the length:
- Iterative version:

```py
def __contains__(self, item: T) -> bool:
    current = self.head
    while current is not None:
        if current.item == item:
            return True
        current = current.link
    return False
```

- Complexity?

  - Best case when found first: O(1)\*CompEq where

    - CompEq is the complexity of == (or **eq**)
    - Often this is O(1)\*O(m), so O(m) where m is the maximum size for an item

  - Worst case when not found: O(n)\*CompEq where
    - n is the length of the list
    - Often this is O(n)*O(m), so O(n*m)

- Let's think how to implement it recursively

### Alternative coding for the same method

```py
def __contains__(self, item: T) -> bool:
    return self.contains_aux(self.head, item)

def contains_aux(self, current: Node, item: T) -> bool:
    if current is None: # base case
        return False
    elif current.item == item
        return True
    else:
        return self.contains_aux(current.link, item)
```

# Recursion II

## Recursion notation

### Some Recursive Notation

- Unary, binary, n-ary recursion:
  - Unary: a single recursive call (all previous code)
  - Binary: two recursive calls (“find a route” example)
  - n-ary: n recursive calls
- Direct vs Indirect recursion:
  - Direct: recursive calls are calls to the same function (all previous examples)
  - Indirect (or mutual): recursion through two or more methods (e.g., method p calls
    method q which in turn calls p again)
- Tail-recursion:
  - Where the result of the recursive call is the result of the function:
    - That is: nothing is done in the “way back”
  - Closest to iteration: can be straightforwardly transformed into it

#### Is it tail recursive?

```py
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
```

### But we can make it tail recursive by using an accumulator

```py
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    return factorial_aux(n,1)

def factorial_aux(n, result: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return result
    else:
        return factorial_aux(n-1, result*n)
```

## From Recursion to Iteration: Accumulators

### Binary recursion: Fibonacci

- Some things are easier to define recursively
  - They are not simple iterations
- Mathematical definition for Fibonacci:

```
        0                        if n = 0
fib(n)  1                        if n = 1
        fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) if      n > 1
```

- Defined almost identically in most programming languages

### Fibonacci’: binary recursive approach

```py
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

### fibonacci's execution: call tree

![fibonaccicalltree](/static/images/FIT1008/fibcalltree.jpg)

complexty: O(2^n)

### Why 2n: think about the call tree

- n is the DEPTH of the binary tree

![fibcalltree](/static/images/FIT1008/fibcalltree2.jpg)

### Fibonacci: recursion with accumulators

```py
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    return fib_aux(n, 0, 1)

def fib_aux(n: int, fm2: int, fm1: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return fm2
    else:
        return fib_aux(n-1, fm1, fm2+fm1)
```

![fibcalltree](/static/images/FIT1008/fibcalltree3.jpg)

### Fibonacci: clarity vs efficiency

- First recursive version is:

  - Very clear
  - Valuable as a description of mathematical properties
  - Poor as a solving algorithm

- Second recursive version (using accumulators) is:
  - Much less clear
  - Much more efficient
  - It can be easily transformed into an iterative version

## From Recursion to Iteration: Stack

### Example: from recursion to iteration

- Consider a method which computes Xn
- It can be done iteratively: a for loop on n
- It can also be done recursively. If you have:

  - X8 can be done as X4 \* X4 (=X4+4=X8)
  - X12 can be done as X6 \* X6 (=X6+6=X12)
  - X25 can be done as X _ X12 _ X12 (=X1+12+12=X25)

- Thus, compute Xn//2 (convergence by n//2) and if

  - n is even: multiply the result by itself
  - n is odd: multiply the result by itself and by X

- Base case: n=0 return 1

### Example: from recursion to iteration

```py
def power(x: int, n: int) -> int:
    tmp = 1
    if n > 0:
        tmp = power(x, n//2)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            tmp = tmp*tmp
        else:
            tmp = tmp*tmp*x
    return tmp
```

### Recall: recursion with the Runtime Stack

- The system implements recursion by using the runtime stack
- Each recursive call reserves a new stack area

  - For the parameters and local variables

- Control is then given to the function

  - To modify its variables according to its definition

- Each time a call finishes
  - Area is removed after transferring the return value to its place

### Direct iterative stack simulation :

```py
def power(x: int, n: int) -> int:
    the_stack = Stack(n)
    while n > 0:
        the_stack.push(n)
        n = n//2

    tmp = 1
    while not the_stack.is_empty():
        if the_stack.pop() % 2 == 0:
            tmp = tmp*tmp
        else:
            tmp = tmp*tmp*x

    return tmp
```

### Advantages/Disadvantages of Recursion

- Advantages:
  - Some times it is more natural (e.g., Fibonacci)
  - Easier to prove correct (due to its mathematical foundations)
  - Easier to analyse (due to its mathematical foundations)
- Disadvantages:
  - Run-time overhead (for tail-recursion, this will depend on the quality of the
    compiler)
  - Memory overhead (fewer local variables versus stack space for function call)
