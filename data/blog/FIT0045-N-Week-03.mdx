# Iteration

**iterators** are one of the most powerful tools in programming

**iterables** are objects that can be iterated upon, meaning that contain a set of countable values that can be traversed in order

lists, strings, tuples and dictionaries are all examples of iterable python objects.

## the for loop

allows you too

- iterate through each element of a list or tuples
- iterate through each character of a string
- iterate through each key and its associated value in a dictionary

### loops variables

```python

#hard coding

print('zuri').count('e')
print('zoe').count('e')
print('lee').count('e')

# with the implementation of the for loop it becomes two lines of code instead of hard coding

for name in ['zuri', 'joe', 'lee']:
    print(name.count('e'))

#other examples of the for loop include

for idx in range(4):
    square = idx*idx
    print(square)

```

another example for the for loop include repeating simple task with diffrent outcomes

```python

for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
    print("Hi", name, "Please come to my party on Saturday!")

```

in this example **name** is called the loop variable or alternatively **iterator variable**
the list of names in the square brackets is the sequence over which we will iterate

the general syntax for 'for loops' is:

```python

for <loop_var_name> in <sequence>:

```

### flow of execution of the for loop

```python

for <loop_var_name> in <sequence>: #have all items had their turn?
    <statment> #if no assign next item to loop variable and execute all statements in th loop vody

#if yes, read next line

```

### strings and for loops

### lists and for loops

examples:

```python

#this will print a list of each fruit within the value of fruits

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:     # by item
    print(fruit)

#using the range function we can repeat a loop for a set amunt of times

print("This will execute first")

for _ in range(3): #instead of 'range 3' we could of writen 'range [0, 1, 2]'
    print("This line will execute three times")
    print("This line will also execute three times")

print("Now we are outside of the for loop!")

# the loop variable '_' is bound to 0 for the first times line 4 and 5 execute

```

coding problem

```python

#these are all the same thing, or atleast will get the same answer
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print("hello")
    i += 1
#this staes that as long as 1 is below 6 then 'hello' will be printed

for n in range(5):
    print("hello")
#the 'range(x)' counts from 0 up to but not including 'x' so 'hello' will be printed 5 times

hi = "hello"
for c in hi:
    print(hi)
#there are 5 characters in hello so 'hello' will be printed 5 times for every character in hello print 'hello'

```

### accumulating values

### Glossary

- **for** is used in 'for loops'
