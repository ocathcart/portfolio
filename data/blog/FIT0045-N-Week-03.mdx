# Iteration

**iterators** are one of the most powerful tools in programming

**iterables** are objects that can be iterated upon, meaning that contain a set of countable values that can be traversed in order

lists, strings, tuples and dictionaries are all examples of iterable python objects.

## the for loop

allows you too

- iterate through each element of a list or tuples
- iterate through each character of a string
- iterate through each key and its associated value in a dictionary

### loops variables

```python

#hard coding

print('zuri').count('e')
print('zoe').count('e')
print('lee').count('e')

# with the implementation of the for loop it becomes two lines of code instead of hard coding

for name in ['zuri', 'joe', 'lee']:
    print(name.count('e'))

#other examples of the for loop include

for idx in range(4):
    square = idx*idx
    print(square)

```

another example for the for loop include repeating simple task with diffrent outcomes

```python

for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
    print("Hi", name, "Please come to my party on Saturday!")

```

in this example **name** is called the loop variable or alternatively **iterator variable**
the list of names in the square brackets is the sequence over which we will iterate

the general syntax for 'for loops' is:

```python

for <loop_var_name> in <sequence>:

```

### flow of execution of the for loop

```python

for <loop_var_name> in <sequence>: #have all items had their turn?
    <statment> #if no assign next item to loop variable and execute all statements in th loop vody

#if yes, read next line

```

### strings and for loops

### lists and for loops

examples:

```python

#this will print a list of each fruit within the value of fruits

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:     # by item
    print(fruit)

#using the range function we can repeat a loop for a set amunt of times

print("This will execute first")

for _ in range(3): #instead of 'range 3' we could of writen 'range [0, 1, 2]'
    print("This line will execute three times")
    print("This line will also execute three times")

print("Now we are outside of the for loop!")

# the loop variable '_' is bound to 0 for the first times line 4 and 5 execute

```

coding problem

```python

#these are all the same thing, or atleast will get the same answer
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print("hello")
    i += 1
#this staes that as long as 1 is below 6 then 'hello' will be printed

for n in range(5):
    print("hello")
#the 'range(x)' counts from 0 up to but not including 'x' so 'hello' will be printed 5 times

hi = "hello"
for c in hi:
    print(hi)
#there are 5 characters in hello so 'hello' will be printed 5 times for every character in hello print 'hello'

```

### accumulating values

has three steps

- **initializing** an 'accumulator' variable to an initial value (such as 0 if accumulating a sum)
- **interating** (e.g traversing the items in a sequence)
- **updating** the accumulator variable on each Iteration

for example:

```python

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
accum = 0
for w in nums: # 'w' has the current item
    accum = accum + w
print(accum)

#where the accumulated value is '55'

```

this is commonly known as a accumulator pattern

and example of the use of 'range'

```python

# 1
print("range(5): ")
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# 2
print("range(0,5): ")
for i in range(0, 5):
    print(i)

# '1' and '2' will print the same thing

# Notice the casting of `range` to the `list`
print(list(range(5))) # 3
print(list(range(0,5))) # 4

# '3' and '4' will print the same thing

print(range(5))

```

and here's an example of using range with accumulation:

```python

accum = 0
for w in range(11):
    accum = accum + w
print(accum)

# or, if you use two inputs for the range function

sec_accum = 0
for w in range(1,11):
    sec_accum = sec_accum + w
print(sec_accum)

```

we can also use loops for counting how many values are in a list:

```python

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
count = 0
for w in nums:
    count = count + 1
print(count)

# in this example we dont make use of w but instead for every change in w we add 1 to the total count

```

## coding challanges

```python

numbers = range(53)
print(list(numbers))

```

## coding challanges 2

```python

str1 = "I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living."
total_characters = 0
for c in str1:
    total_characters += 1

print(total_characters)

```

## coding challange 3

```python

numbers = range(41)
sum1 = 0
for n in numbers:
    sum1 = sum1 + n

print(sum1)

```

### traversal and the for loop: By index

```python

fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']
for n in range(5):
    print(n, fruits[n])

```

considering this list we have each fruit at a certain position, 'apple' is at position 0, 'pear' at 1 and so on.
from this we can iterate through the indexes by geenrating a sequence using teh range function

example problem:

```python

s = "python"
for idx in range(len(s)):
   print(s[idx % 2])

```

in this problem, everytime idx is even we get a 0 becuase there are no lefovers and so it print the character at position 0 which is 'p'

## extra tips with debugging for loops
