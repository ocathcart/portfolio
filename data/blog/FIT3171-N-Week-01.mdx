## What are Databases?

some things that may influence the creation of a database as to why you would need one are as such:

    - the size of the database (can go from small to big)

    - ease of updating the maintaining the database (what would happen is many people would start updating at the same time)

    - the accuracy fo the database (what would prevent me from missing vital information or typing incorrectly)

    - security of it (who would get to view and edit the data)

    - redundancy (duplication of the data can create missinformation, (backup))

    - imporatants of the data (how inportant is the data)

Solutions?:

    - scalable

    - accessible

    - accurate

    - secure

    - consistent

    - permanent

## Database Fundamentals

# Textbook: Chapter 1:

## Why databases?

idk thye have a lot of shit in them and do a lot of shit kinda, its pretty cool, they stroe a ton of data that can be retrieved in seconds, CRAZY!

## Data Versus information

_Data_ consist of raw facts, A.K.A, they jahve yet to be processed to reveal their meaning

there are four steps into transforming raw data:

    - Data entry screening (caputers data through relevant fields like name, age , etc)

    - Raw data is generated on the basis of information captured from the fields of the data entry screening

    - the information gathered is presented in a summary format

    - information is presented in a graphical format

_information_ is the result of processing raw data

## Introducing Databases:

A _database_ is a shared, intergrated computer structure that stores a collection of the following:

    - End-user data: this is, raw facts of interest to the end user

    - Metadata, or data about data, through which the end-user data is intergradted and managed

        - Metadata describes the data characteristics and the set of relationshps that links the data found within the database

A _database managment system (DBSM)_ is a collection of programs that manages the database structure and contoles access to the data stored in the database.
The database represents a filling cabinet and the DBSM represents a person who keeps it organized.

### Role and Advantages if the DBMS

The _DBSM servers_ are the intermediary between the user and the database.

A DBMS offers many advantages:

    - Improves data sharing: DBMS creates an enviroment in which end users have better access to more and better managed data.

    - Improved data security: DBMS provides a framework for better enforcement of data privact and security policies.

    - Better data intergration: it becomes much easier to see how actions in one segment of the compant affect other segments

    - Minimized data inconsistency: *Data inconsistency* exist when diffrent versions of the same data appear in diffrent places

    - Improved data access: The DBSM makes it possible to produce quick answers to ad hoc quesries

        - A *query* is a specific request issued to the DBMS for data manipulation

            - for example to read or update data

        - A *ad goc query* is a spur-of-the-moment question

        an answer to a query is called a *query result set*

    - Improved decision making: *Data quality* is a comprehensive approach to promosting the accuracy, validity, and timeliness of the data. DBSM provides a framework to facilitate data quality initiatives

    - Increased end-user productivity

## Types of Databases

Classification by number of users:

    - A *single-user database* supports onle one user at a time. A single user database that runs on a personal computer is called a *desktop database*

    - A *multiuser database* supports multiple users as the same time

        - When the database supports a small amount of users in the database at the same time it is called a *workgroup database*.

        - When the databse supports many users at the same time it is called a *enterprise database*

Classification by locations:

    - Databases that support data located at a single site are called *centralized databases*

    - Databases that support data distributed across severel diffrent sites is called a *distributed/decentralized database*

cloud databases:

    - a *Cloud database* is a database that is created and maintained using cloud data services

## Hierarchical and Network Models

the _Hierarchical model_ is a flipped around tree where the top splits into many _segments_. Each segment can have many children but a _child segment_ can have only one _parent segment_

The _network model_ is confusing :)

    - the *schema* is the conceptual orginization of the entire database as viwed by the database administrator

    - The *subchema* defines the portion of the database "seen" by the application programs that actually produce the desired information from the daya within the database

    - A *data manipulation language (DML)* defines the environment in which data can be manages and is used to work with the data in the database

    - A schema *data definition language (DDL)* eneables the database administrator to define the schema components

## The relation model

The relation model is a database model

    - a *relation/table* can be thought of as a two-dimentional structure composed of intersecting rows and columns.

        - Each row in a relation is called a *tuples*

        - Each column represents an attribute

the relation data model is implemented though the _relational database managment system (RDBMS)_. the RDBMS does the same things at the Hierarchical and network model but more and better
