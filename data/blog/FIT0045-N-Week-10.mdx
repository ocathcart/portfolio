# what is recursion

is a form of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller problems

# the three laws of recursion:

- A recursive algorithm must have a **base case**. the base case is the condtiotion that allows the algorithm to stop recursing
- A recursive algorithm must change its state and move towards the base case.
- A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively

# converting an interger to a string in any base
