# Conflict Resolution with Linear Probing

# Conflict Resolution Add

## Hash Table operations: Add

- Apply the hash function to get a hash value (position) N
- Try to add key at position N
- Deal with collision / conflict if any

For clarity:

- We shall refer to a situation of ℎ��ℎ(���1) = ℎ��ℎ(���2) as a
  collision while a conflict is assumed to occur when a position in the
  hash table we attempt to use for a given key is already occupied.

Example: Add

## Revision: two main approaches to conflict resolution

- Separate chaining:
  - Each array position contains a **linked list** of items
  - Upon collision, either update (same key) or add the element to the linked list
- Open addressing:
  - Each array position contains a **single item**
  - Upon collision, either update (same key) or use an empty space to store the new
    item (which empty space depends on the technique)
  - As we will see:
    - Requires an array of at least **double the size** of the number of elements
    - Thus, we must be able to estimate in advance the number of elements (or risk a
      dynamic resize)

## Open Addressing: Linear Probing

- Add item with hash value N:
  - If array[N] is empty: put item there
  - If there is already an item there with:
    - A different key:
  - search for the first empty space in the array from N+1
  - add the item there (if any)
    - Same key: update the data associated to the key
- Basically: linear search from N until an empty slot is found
- But careful, you must deal with:
  - Full table (to avoid going into an infinite loop)
  - Restarting from position 0 if the end of table is reached

from typing import TypeVar, Generic
T = TypeVar('T')

class LinearProbeTable(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, size: int = 7919) -> None:
        self.count = 0
        self.table = ArrayR(size)

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return self.count

    def hash(self, key: str) -> int:
        value = 0
        a = 31415
        b = 27183
        for char in key:
            value = (ord(char) + a*value) % len(self.table)
            a = a * b % (len(self.table)-1)

        return value
```

## Reminder: Adding in Linear Probing

- Add item with hash value N:

  - If array[N] is empty: put item there
  - If there is already an item there with:

    - A different key:

      - search for the first empty space in the array from N+1
      - add the item there (if any)

    - Same key: update the data associated to the key

- Basically: linear search from N until an empty slot is found
- But careful, you must deal with:
  - **Full** table (to avoid going into an infinite loop)
  - Restarting from position 0 if the end of table is reached

## Adding algorithm for Linear Probing

- The algorithm for add(key,data) for linear probing is as follows
- Get the **position** N using the hash function N = hash(key)
- If **array[N] is empty**, just put the item (key, data) there
- Else, if there is **already an item** there:
  - If the item has the same key: update the data
  - If it has a different key, keep looking in next cell (wrapping around)
    - What if we never find it and there is no empty spot?
    - Then we need to rehash: create a bigger array and reinsert all items
- We must traverse the table before we can rehash:
  - Even if it is known to be full, in case the key is already in (we are doing an update)
  - Also, as we will see later, rehash in Linear Probing should happen much earlier
    than when the table is full…

```py
def __setitem__(self, key: str, data: T) -> None:
    position = self.hash(key) # get the position using hash

    for _ in range(len(self.table)): # start traversing
        if self.table[position] is None: # found empty slot
            self.table[position] = (key, data)
            self.count += 1
            return

        elif self.table[position][0] == key:# found key
            self.table[position] = (key, data)
            return

        else: # not found, try next
            position = (position+1) % len(self.table)

    self.rehash() # move everything to a new, larger table
    self.__setitem__(key, data) #try again
```

![hashsetitem](/static/images/FIT1008/hashsetitemimpl.jpg)

implementing `__str__`

```py
def __str__(self) -> str:
    result = ""
    for item in self.array:
        if item is not None:
            (key, value) = item
            result += "(" + str(key) + "," + str(value) + ")\n"
    return result
```

# Conflict Resolution Search

## Searching in Linear Probing

- Search for an item with hash value N:
  - Perform a linear search from array[N] until either the item or an empty space is
    found (if so, raise a KeyError(key) exception)
- But careful, you must deal again with:
  - Full table (to avoid going into an infinite loop)
  - Restarting from position 0 if the end of table is reached

## Searching algorithm for Linear Probing

- The algorithm for search(key,data) is as follows
- Get the position N using the hash function N = hash(key)
- If array[N] is empty, raise a KeyError(key) exception
- Else, if there is already an item there:
  - If the item has the same key: return the associated data
  - If it has a different key, keep looking
    - What if we never find the key and there is no empty spot?
    - Then we raise a `KeyError(key)` exception
- We used `__setitem__` for adding
- We will use `__getitem__` for searching

implementing `__getitem__`

```py
def __getitem__(self, key: str) -> T:
    position = self.hash(key) # get the position using hash

    for _ in range(len(self.table)): # start traversing
        if self.table[position] is None: # found empty slot
            raise KeyError(key) # so the key is not in
        elif self.table[position][0] == key:# found key
            return self.table[position][1] #return data
        else: # there is something but not the key, try next
            position = (position+1) % len(self.table)
    # At this point, I have gone through the table and not found
    raise KeyError(key)
```

combine the `__setitem__` and `__getitem__` to get the `linear_probe` function

```py
def __linear_probe(self, key: str, is_search: bool) -> int:
    position = self.hash(key)

    for _ in range(len(self.table)):
        if self.table[position] is None: # found empty slot
            if is_search: # if searching
                raise KeyError(key) # key is not in
            else:
                return position # if adding, return position
        elif self.table[position][0] == key: # found key
            return position
        else: # there is something but not the key, try next
            position = (position + 1) % len(self.table)

    raise KeyError(key)

def __getitem__(self, key: str) -> T:
    position = self.__linear_probe(key, True)

    return self.table[position][1]

def __setitem__(self, key: str, data: T) -> None:
    try:
        position = self.__linear_probe(key, False)

    except KeyError:
        self.__rehash()
        self.__setitem__(key, data) # try again

    else:
        if self.table[position] is None: # if it’s a new item
            self.count += 1
        self.table[position] = (key, data)
```

# Conflict Resolution Delete

## Deleting in Linear Probing

- What about delete?
  - Use the search function to find the item
  - If found at N, then what?
- Should we simply delete it and leave it empty?
  - No, as empty spots have meaning in linear probing…
- Should we shuffle everything from N+1 upwards?
  - From N+1 to what?
    - To the first empty position
  - Is shuffling a good idea though?
    - No, we might move items that were in the correct positions!

![hashbaddelete](static/images/FIT1008/hashbaddelete.jpg)
One possibility: - If found at N, reinsert every item from N+1 to the first empty position - Time consuming! (though should not be many)

implementation: good delete

```py
def __delitem__(self, key: str) -> None:
    pos = self.__linear_probe(key, False)
    self.table[pos] = None
    self.count -= 1

    pos = (pos + 1) % len(self.table)
    while self.table[pos] is not None:
        item = self.table[pos]
        self.table[pos] = None
        self.count -= 1
        self[str(item[0])] = item[1]
        pos = (pos + 1) % len(self.table)
```

## Conflict Resolution Open Addressing

## Open Addressing: Linear Probing

- Another possibility for delete:
  - Use a special symbol (a sentinel) to denote delete
  - Modify add and search to take that symbol into account
    - For search: treat the sentinel as you would treat a cell with a key different to the one
      you are searching for (keep on looking) - If found, you could move it to the first deleted cell you found - What else would need to be done?
    - For add: treat it as empty and add it in the first deleted cell
      - But this only works for new keys (those not already in the table)
      - If you want updates… think about it!

## Open Addressing: Linear Probing

- Load factor: total number of items/TABLESIZE
- Cluster: sequence of full hash table slots (i.e., without an empty slot)
- Cluster can form even when the load is small
- Once a cluster forms, it tends to grow larger
  - Items that hash to a value within the cluster, get added at the end making it bigger
  - This might involve more than one hash value

### Example of cluster

- All 4 elements are part of a cluster
- Two of them have the same hash value:
  - Kruse and Horowtiz (5)
- The other two have different hash values (0 and 1)
- From then on, any element mapped to 0,1,5 or 6
  will be part of the cluster. And adding elements
  mapped to 0,1,2,4,5, or 6 will make it grow.

![excluster](/static/images/FIT1008/excluster.jpg)

## Linear Probing: Problems

- Tendency for clustering to occur as the load is > 0.5
- Low speed on clustering:
  - Adding a key with hash value N can drastically increase the search time for keys
    with values other than N
  - Deletion can also be time consuming, as the entire cluster needs to be rehashed
  - This means we start to under-deliver on the O(1) promise
- If implemented in arrays - table may become full fairly quickly, resizing is
  time and resource consuming

## Open Addressing

- You must keep the load under 2/3
  - Otherwise the probe length (i.e.,
    number of items visited before the
    element is found/not found) is too
    high
- Even better: under 1/2

# Conclusion

- Hash Tables are one of the most used data types, as they have expected
  O(1) complexity for adding, deleting and searching, if built properly

- You have a very good chance of using them in your professional career
- They are very simple conceptually
- But they are also very “empirical”:
  - A significant amount of experimental evaluation is usually needed to fine tune the
    hash function and the TABLESIZE
- A good choice of hash function, collision handling and load factor are
  crucial to maintaining an efficient hash table (i.e., keep the O(1) promise)

# Workshop

**collision**: when two diffrent hash keys passed to a hash function produce the same hash value

**Conflict**: This occurs when attempting to add or update a value in the hash table, when visiting the initial hash position, if the keys do not mathch, a conflic has occured
this is caused by a previous collision (directly or indirectly)
