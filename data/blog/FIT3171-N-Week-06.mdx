# Considering Personal Data in Database Design Creating & Altering the Database

## Considering Personal Data in Database Design Not Assessed

## Collecting personal customer data for drone rental

- When a company/ business collects personal
  information they must take reasonable steps to
  tell you what they will do with it
- Some personal information is considered
  “sensitive” and requires explicit consent to be
  collected
- Privacy, Equal Opportunity and Discrimination
  laws govern the collection and use of personal
  data (see Week 1)

### What personal customer data should you collect?

- Name (do you need to collect first, last and middle name?)
- Preferred name (do you need to know how customers want to be addressed?)
- Contact details (address, phone, email?)
- Preferred method of contact (from above)
- Age or Date of Birth (does a renter need to be over 18?)
- Title (will you be sending them formal mail or correspondence?)
- Gender (do you want to understand who your customer base is and how to
  reach all genders?)
- Language spoken at home (do you want to reach potential customers in multiple
  languages?)
- Special needs/ accessibility (do you want to cater for customers with special
  needs or accessibility requests?)

### What personal data should you collect for Drone customers?

- Based on the Drone case study, discuss some attributes that you may suggest to
  the client that will benefit their business - What are the attributes you would recommend to your client? - How will these attributes benefit the owner of HiFlying drone in developing
  their future business? - What are the risks of collecting data about the attributes? - What are the risks of not collecting data about the attributes?

### Adding attributes that record personal information

- When adding an attribute that records personal information such as
  gender you must consider whether: - the attribute can be null or not (e.g. how important is the data?) - visualised by null or not null sign - the possible values for the attribute: - Fixed values, such as 'M' for Men, 'W' for Women, or 'U' for
  Undisclosed - implemented by check constraint - Extendable values, such as Men, Women, and other options - implemented by look up table

```SQL
ALTER TABLE customer ADD CONSTRAINT chk_custgender
CHECK ( cust_gender IN ( 'M', 'F', 'U' ));
```

![lookuptable](/static/images/FIT3173/lookupconstraint.jpg)

### What do you really need to collect?

- Titles are a proxy for gender, so you may not need to ask for both
- If titles and gender are not integral to your business - get rid of them entirely
- If titles are somewhat important, but you suspect your customers are unlikely to
  require more unusual options - go for Mr, Mrs, Ms, Miss, Mx and perhaps other
- If titles are vital and you know you have some customers with unusual titles - use
  a free text box instead of a drop down

## Creating & Altering the Database

![editmodel](/static/images/FIT3171/editmodel.jpg)

### SQL general syntax

- A single statement is ended with SEMICOLON.
- Predefined KEYWORDs represent clauses (components) of a statement.
- Keywords are NOT case sensitive.
- Examples:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE unit
    (
        unit_code CHAR(7)NOT NULL,
        unit_name VARCHAR2(50)CONSTRAINT uq_unit_name UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        CONSTRAINT pk_unit PRIMARY KEY (unit_code)
    );
SELECT * FROM unit;
```

### SQL Statements

- Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - Creating database structure
    - CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - Adding and Manipulating database contents (rows)
    - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  - Retrieving data from database
    - SELECT
- Data Control Language (DCL)
  - Set permissions on objects
    - GRANT

## CREATE A TABLE (DDL)

### Common ORACLE data types

- **Text**: CHAR(size), VARCHAR2(size)
  - e.g., CHAR(10), VARCHAR2(10)
  - CHAR(10) → ‘apple’ = ‘apple ‘
  - VARCHAR2(10) → ‘apple’ != ‘apple ‘
- **Numbers**: NUMBER(precision, scale)
  - Weight NUMBER(7) or NUMBER(7,0) → Weight = 7456124
  - Weight NUMBER(9,2) → Weight = 7456123.89
  - Weight NUMBER(8,1) → Weight = 7456123.9
- **Date/Time**: DATE, TIMESTAMP
  - DATE can store a date and time (time to seconds), stored as Julian date
  - TIMESTAMP can store a date and a time (up to fractions of a second)
  - TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

### Column VS Table Level Constraints

```SQL
CREATE TABLE training (
    train_code CHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    train_desc VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    train_hrs NUMBER(2) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT training_pk PRIMARY KEY (train_code)
);
```

```SQL
CREATE TABLE customer (
    cust_id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
    cust_fname VARCHAR2(25) NOT NULL,
    cust_lname VARCHAR2(25) NOT NULL,
    cust_phone CHAR(12) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT customer_pk PRIMARY KEY ( cust_id )
);
```

```SQL
CREATE TABLE cust_train (
    ct_id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
    train_code CHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    cust_id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
    ct_date_start DATE NOT NULL,
    ct_date_expire DATE NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT cust_train_pk PRIMARY KEY ( ct_id ),
    CONSTRAINT cust_train_uq UNIQUE ( train_code, cust_id, ct_date_start ),
    CONSTRAINT training_cust_train FOREIGN KEY ( train_code )
        REFERENCES training ( train_code ),
    CONSTRAINT customer_cust_train FOREIGN KEY ( cust_id )
        REFERENCES customer ( cust_id )
);
```

![tableconstraint](/static/images/FIT3171/tableconstraint.jpg)

### Alternative (BETTER) method of defining FKs

```SQL
CREATE TABLE cust_train (
    ct_id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
    train_code CHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    cust_id NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
    ct_date_start DATE NOT NULL,
    ct_date_expire DATE NOT NULL
);
ALTER TABLE cust_train
    ADD
        (CONSTRAINT cust_train_pk PRIMARY KEY ( ct_id ),
        CONSTRAINT training_cust_train FOREIGN KEY ( train_code )
        REFERENCES training ( train_code ),
        CONSTRAINT customer_cust_train FOREIGN KEY ( cust_id )
        REFERENCES customer ( cust_id ),
        CONSTRAINT cust_train_uq UNIQUE ( train_code, cust_id, ct_date_start));
```

### Referential Integrity

- To ensure referential integrity, SQL defines three possible actions for
  FKs in relations when a deletion of a primary key occurs: - RESTRICT (Oracle No Action basically equivalent) - Deletion of tuples is NOT ALLOWED for those tuples in the table
  referred by the FK (the table containing PK) if there is corresponding
  tuple in the table containing the FK.
- CASCADE
  - A deletion of a tuple in the table referred by the FK (the table containing
    PK) will result in the deletion of the corresponding tuples in the table
    containing the FK.
- NULLIFY
  - A deletion of a tuple in the table referred by the FK (the table containing
    PK) will result in the update of the corresponding tuples in the table
    containing the FK to NULL.

### What Referential Integrity Constraint to implement?

- Use the model to decide on what referential integrity constraint to
  implement. - Mandatory vs Optional participation.

- The constraints must be decided at the design phase.

### COMPOSITE FK's

Returning to the DRONE case before a surrogate key for
CUST_TRAIN was added

What PK for cust_train and FK for the "authorises" relationship is
required?

### COMPOSITE FK's

PK for CUST_TRAIN

```SQL
ALTER TABLE cust_train
    ADD CONSTRAINT cust_train_pk PRIMARY KEY ( train_code,
        cust_id,
        ct_date_start );
```

Mapping of "authorises" relationship (FK in RENTAL)

```SQL
ALTER TABLE rental
    ADD CONSTRAINT cust_train_rental FOREIGN KEY ( train_code,
        cust_id,
        ct_date_start )
    REFERENCES cust_train ( train_code,
        cust_id,
        ct_date_start );
```

### ALTER TABLE

- Used to change a tables structure.
- For example:
  - Adding column(s).
  - Removing column(s).
  - Adding constraint(s) - used previously for FK's, but can be any
    constraint
  - Removing constraint(s)

Add a new attribute to store whether training courses are paid(P) or free(F):

```SQL
ALTER TABLE training_course ADD (
    traincourse_type CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'P' NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT chk_traincourse_type CHECK ( traincourse_type IN ( 'P', 'F' ) )
);
```

### Manipulate Constraints

- Turn constraint ON or OFF to temporarily disable
  - ALTER TABLE cust_train
  ```SQL
  DISABLE CONSTRAINT training_cust_train;
  ```
  - ALTER TABLE cust_train
    ```SQL
    ENABLE CONSTRAINT training_cust_train;
    ```
- Remove/re add constraint to modify constraint
  - ALTER TABLE cust_train
    ```SQL
    DROP CONSTRAINT training_cust_train;
    ```
  - ALTER TABLE cust_train
    - ADD
    ```SQL
    ( CONSTRAINT training_cust_train FOREIGN KEY ( train_code )
    REFERENCES training ( train_code ) ON DELETE CASCADE);
    ```

### DELETING A TABLE

- Use the DROP statement.
- Examples:

```SQL
DROP TABLE customer PURGE;
```

    - will not work, why?

```SQL
DROP TABLE customer CASCADE CONSTRAINTS PURGE;
```

- Constraints purge leaves data in CUST_TRAIN removes FK constraint:
