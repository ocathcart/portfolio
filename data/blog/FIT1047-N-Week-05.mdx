# Input Output

## Input/Output

- Anything else connected to the computer
- Keyboard, touch screen, mouse, sound, GPS, gyroscope, printer, hard disk, USB, …

## Early I/O

The first computers had very limited I/O.

- Punched paper tape or cards
- Teleprinters

## Modern I/O

- **Input**: Keyboard, mouse, touch pad, touch screen, microphones, cameras, gestures, accelerometers, barometers, GPS, LIDAR, …
  **Output**: Screens, printers, audio, vibration motors, smart home appliances, robots, … Also: storage (hard disks, SSDs, SD cards), network devices (WiFi, 4G/5G, Ethernet, Bluetooth, …)

## Modern I/O interfaces

I/O devices are now usually connected
via **interfaces**:

- Standardised connectors and protocols
- Can be internal or external Examples: USB, PCIe, HDMI, ...

## I/O characteristics

Why have **different standards**?
I/O interfaces can't be good at everything at once:

- **Convenience** (e.g. simple, robust plug)
- **Speed** (keyboard, touchpad need low data rates, graphics card needs extremely high data rate)
- **Cost** (interface for a $5 USB drive needs to be cheap, but for a $1,000 graphics card can be more expensive)
- **Compatibility** (use external device with multiple computers and over long timeframe)

# I/O and the CPU

## I/O and the CPU

The CPU needs to receive data from and send data to I/O devices.
Why send to input devices?

- E.g. set sensitivity, calibrate, switch on/off, …

Why receive from output devices?

- E.g. check if ready, check if successful, …

## I/O register

Each I/O device has its own **registers**.

- E.g. keyboard: register holds the currently pressed key.

How can the CPU access these registers?
Two (main) methods:

- memory-mapped I/O
- port-mapped I/O

## Memory-mapped I/O

Each I/O register is **“mapped”** to a special memory address.
Use `Load/Store` to access the device.
Example: keyboard register mapped to `A000`.

- Load A000 loads currently pressed key into `AC` register.

  - Example: printer register is mapped to `A100`.

- Store `A100` stores current AC value in printer register (which then gets printed out).

## Memory-mapped I/O

Advantages:

- No new instructions needed
- Simple

Disadvantages:

- Uses up some memory addresses (overall amount of addressable memory is reduced)
- Programs may accidentally access I/O (when the program has a bug)

## port-mapped I/O

- Add special I/O instructions to the ISA
- Each I/O register still has an address (as in memory-mapped I/O)
- But these addresses are now separate from memory, and called **port**
- For example

  - Load `A000` loads from memory address `A000`
  - Input `A000` loads from I/O register `A000` (e.g. the keyboard)

- Also known as instruction-based I/O

## Memory- vs port-mapped I/O

Early PCs:

- 1 MB of memory addressable (2^20 addresses)
- But only 640 kB usable for programs, rest partly used for I/O
- ISA could handle both port-mapped and memory-mapped

Modern computers:

- 64 bit address space leaves more than enough room for memory-mapped I/O
- Small embedded microcontrollers may still use ports

# Polling, Interupts and DMA

## when to perform I/O

Now we know how the CPU can talk to an I/O device.
But I/O devices are **much, much slower** than the CPU.
So **when** should the CPU communicate?

- How does it know that a key has been pressed?
- How does it know that a printer is ready to receive the next character?

Two methods: programmed and interrupt-based I/O.

## programmed I/O

The programmer writes code that **periodically checks** I/O (also called polling I/O).
Example code:

```py
while True:
    if keyboardRegister.canRead():
        processKeyboardRegister()
    elif printerRegister.canWrite():
        processPrinterRegister()
    normalProgramCode()
```

Advantages:

- Very simple (no extra hardware needed)
- Programmer is in full control (e.g. poll 10,000 times/s for network, 10 times/s for keyboard?)

Disadvantages:

- Program must poll regularly
- Program is “I/O-driven” (constructed around I/O)
- CPU is constantly busy (high power consumption)

Programmed I/O is mostly used in embedded special-purpose systems.

## Interrupts

Opposite of **polling**:

- CPU is **notified** by hardware when it should communicate with I/O
- CPU interrupts current program, executes special **interrupt handler** code, then continues normal program
- Programmer can write separate code for main program and interrupt handler (better separation of concerns)

## Interupts signals

I/O device **notifies** CPU using special signal (“wire”) that it wants to interrupt.
CPU checks before each fetch-decode-execute:

- Does a device request an interrupt?
  - **Yes**: call interrupt handler.
  - **No**: continue with normal fetch-decode execute.

## Interupt handlers

Can run at any time, just before any instruction.
Handlers must **leave CPU in the same state** as before the interrupt when they return!
This is called a **context switch**. It can be achieved by

- **Hardware: shadow registers** CPU switches to a separate register file while processing an interrupt
- **Software**: handler must be written so it restores all registers as required

## Interupt in old PCs

Original IBM PC design:

- 15 interrupt request (IRQ) signals
- Hardware must be configured to use the correct IRQ
- May result in conflicts
- Devices have to share IRQs

## Modern Interrupts

Computers now use **Advanced Programmable** Interrupt Controllers (APICs).

- Integrated into CPU
- Support more IRQs (which results in fewer conflicts)
- Include high-resolution timers
  - E.g. cause an interrupt every millisecond
  - We will see later why that's useful!

## Disadvantages of interrupts

Different devices may need different priorities

- E.g. keyboard (very low) vs graphics card (very high priority)
- Can be achieved using different interrupt signals

**All memory transfers** run through the CPU

- E.g. read byte from disk, store into memory; or
- Read byte from memory, transfer to graphics card
  I/O devices are fully controlled by CPU

## Direct Memory access (DMA)

Modern CPUs can delegate memory transfer to a **dedicated controller**.

- Hard disk controller can transfer data directly to RAM
- Graphics card can fetch image directly from RAM
- CPU is free to perform other tasks

CPU and DMA controller share the data and address bus:

- Only one can perform memory transfer at the same time

# Operating systems

## What does a OS do?

An OS is a **level of abstraction** between hardware and
software:

![OS](/statuc/images/FIT1047/OS.jpg)

## Modern OS

- Hundreds of processes running simultaneously
- Provide access to diverse range of hardware
- Full networking support built-in
- Are somewhat related to UNIX

  - Linux: free re-implementation of UNIX
  - macOS: based on BSD UNIX
  - Windows: not directly related but heavily influenced

- Usually come with lots of helper applications

## Main goal: Ease of use

For end users:

- Provide consistent user interface
- Manage multiple processes / applications simultaneously
- Protect user from malicious / buggy code

For programmers:

- Provide programming interface
- Enable access to hardware and I/O devices
- Manage resources (memory, disk, network)

This introduces a level of abstraction between hardware and software.

## abstraction

Probably the **most important concept in IT**!

- Hide complexity from users
- Provide clean, well-defined interfaces to functionality

Examples:

- Calling **print** in a Python program doesn't require any knowledge of how printing works, how it's implemented, whether it's going to print into a window or a file
- Requesting a web page doesn't require any knowledge of whether the Internet connection uses WiFi, Ethernet, 4G, …

## The OS kernel

The core abstractions managed by any OS are

- Process management
- Memory management
- I/O management

These are implemented in the OS kernel.

## Abstraction in OS

**Virtualisation**

- Provide **virtual** form of each **physical** resource for each **process**

This means you can write code as if your program

- has the entire CPU to itself
- has a large contiguous block of memory to itself
- can use system resources through library functions (e.g. keyboard, graphics, disk, network)

# Multi-processing

## Multiple current processes

Lots of processes are running simultaneously here. But CPUs can only execute one instruction at a time! How does that work?

## Timesharing

The solution:

- OS kernel **switches periodically** between processes.
- If switching is fast and occurs often, it creates the **illusion of concurrency**!
- This illusion works for both programmers and end users.

Multi-processing exaple:

## Challanges

Performance:

- Switching should not create a huge overhead Control:
  - CPU must stay in control
  - Enable fair scheduling (each process gets fair amount of time)
  - Protect against malicious and buggy code

## Solution: User vs Kernel mode

CPUs have two different modes of operation.
**Kernel mode**:

- Code runs with **no restrictions**, full access to hardware
- The OS runs in kernel mode
- Any **interrupt** triggers a switch into kernel mode and runs the interrupt handler (part of the OS)

**User mode**:

- Only **limited subset of instructions** is allowed
- E.g. **no I/O instructions**
- Normal applications run in user mode

## System calls

So how can a user program perform I/O?
It calls a library function that's part of the OS!
This is called a **system call**.
Usually implemented using a **special instruction**.
System calls switch from user to kernel mode.

## Timers

How can the CPU stop a running process to switch to a different one?

Use a **timer circuit** that generates **regular interrupts**.

Remember: interrupts switch to kernel mode and run the OS's interrupt handler.

This interrupts the current process, puts the OS in control and allows it to switch to a different process.

## When to swtich?

The OS should switch between processes frequently to create the illusion of concurrency.

One method for achieving a **fair schedule** of process switches is **round-robin time-slicing**.

We'll just look at an example.

# Virutal memory

## Memory safety

Let's assume our two processes from before: a web browser and a media player app.

Both store data in memory.

What prevents the media player from accessing memory used by the browser and steal e.g. your banking details?

**Virtual memory**!

## Virtual memory

Goal: no process can access any memory except its own.

Mechanism:

- Each process has its own address space
- Addresses used by user programs are called virtual addresses
- The OS maps virtual addresses to physical addresses in RAM

## Virtual-memory - OS + hardware

How does a process know which addresses to use?

- Process **requests** memory from OS via system call
- OS sets up mapping from virtual to physical addresses in a special hardware module, the memory management unit (MMU)
- OS returns virtual start address of memory block to the process

So what happens when the CPU executes e.g. `Load 1A20`?

- The MMU translates virtual 1A20 address into the physical RAM address
- MMU also checks whether the physical address belongs to the current process (if not, creates interrupt so OS can shut down the process)

## Huge virtual memory

RAM is limited.

E.g. 8GB or 16GB may not be enough for code and data of all running processes.

Use **virtual memory**:

- Save **currently unused** blocks of RAM to external storage
- When a process tries to access this block, the MMU will raise an interrupt (**"page fault"**)
- OS handles the interrupt and loads block back into RAM after storing another block to external storage to make space (called **“swapping”** the blocks)

This works well if swapping isn't too frequent!
