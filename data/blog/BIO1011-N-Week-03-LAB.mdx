# Labs in BIO1011

Pre-lab quiz

Lab class

Post-Lab

aims of lab 1:

- apply scientific method to real-world scenarios
- to udentify compounds in sicientif methods and their value in data analysis
- to gain experience using common laboratory techniques, used in industry
- to communicate scietific findings in a written format

Lab 1 outcomes:

- quantify the number of **faecal coliforms** in river water using direct and indirect measurements
- prepare a standard curve ot plot the relationship between absorbance and CFU/ml
- use compound microscope to make scientific observations
- Gain awareness of the commercial application of biological principles and techniques

## backround

- gouvernment agencies need to monitor public waterways to ensure safety to the general public
- occasional'y, public waterways can become contaminated with harmful biological agents such as **faecak coliforms** which are potentially the most dangerous to our health

### faecal coliforms

- are bacteria that commonly reside in the digestive tract of warm blooded animals and are shed in high concentration in their faeces
- their presence in water is an indication of faecal matter contamination
- high levels increase the likelyhood of disease transmission (e.g cholera, typhoid, dysentery)

### scenario

- High levels of faecal coliforms have been detected in a melbourne waterways
- sewage treatment plant is the suspected original
- Water samples have been collected at various locations along the river
- water has been collected from various zones along the pattison river
- to find the origins of the faecal coliforms we must find the most concentrated area of faecal origins

### what happens during lab?

- **Part A** - indirect measurements of faecal copliforms using spectrophotometer
- **Part B** - spread plating of water samples onto agar for the direct measurement of faecal coliforms in water
- **Part c** - determination of the number of faecal coliforms in water samples
- **Part D** - direct observation of suspected coliforms from water samples to confirm morphology

### Part A

- an indirect method
- All facal coliforms produce the β-galactosidase. which can break dowb the substrate ONPG
- a spectrophotometercan measure the absorbance of the resultant solution
- when ONPG is mixed with water you get a clear solution, and when mixed with β-galactosidase it produces a compound which turns the water yellow
- the tint of the yellow directly correlates to the concentration of β-galactosidase which then correlates to the presence of faecal coliforms

## spectrophotometry
