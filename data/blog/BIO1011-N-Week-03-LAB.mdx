# Labs in BIO1011

Pre-lab quiz

Lab class

Post-Lab

## aims of lab 1:

- apply scientific method to real-world scenarios
- to udentify compounds in sicientif methods and their value in data analysis
- to gain experience using common laboratory techniques, used in industry
- to communicate scietific findings in a written format

## Lab 1 outcomes:

- quantify the number of **faecal coliforms** in river water using direct and indirect measurements
- prepare a standard curve ot plot the relationship between absorbance and CFU/ml
- use compound microscope to make scientific observations
- Gain awareness of the commercial application of biological principles and techniques

## backround

- gouvernment agencies need to monitor public waterways to ensure safety to the general public
- occasional'y, public waterways can become contaminated with harmful biological agents such as **faecak coliforms** which are potentially the most dangerous to our health

### faecal coliforms

- are bacteria that commonly reside in the digestive tract of warm blooded animals and are shed in high concentration in their faeces
- their presence in water is an indication of faecal matter contamination
- high levels increase the likelyhood of disease transmission (e.g cholera, typhoid, dysentery)

### scenario

- High levels of faecal coliforms have been detected in a melbourne waterways
- sewage treatment plant is the suspected original
- Water samples have been collected at various locations along the river
- water has been collected from various zones along the pattison river
- to find the origins of the faecal coliforms we must find the most concentrated area of faecal origins

### what happens during lab?

- **Part A** - indirect measurements of faecal copliforms using spectrophotometer
- **Part B** - spread plating of water samples onto agar for the direct measurement of faecal coliforms in water
- **Part c** - determination of the number of faecal coliforms in water samples
- **Part D** - direct observation of suspected coliforms from water samples to confirm morphology

# Part A

- an indirect method
- All facal coliforms produce the β-galactosidase. which can break dowb the substrate ONPG
- a spectrophotometercan measure the absorbance of the resultant solution
- when ONPG is mixed with water you get a clear solution, and when mixed with β-galactosidase it produces a compound which turns the water yellow
- the tint of the yellow directly correlates to the concentration of β-galactosidase which then correlates to the presence of faecal coliforms

## spectrophotometry tech function

- we shine light onto a collimator, through a monochromator, then through a wavelength selector, through the sample onto a digital display(photocell).
- depending on the amount of light that gets through will determine the concentration of β-galactosidase.
- the lower the number hte higher the concentration because that water would of absorbed more light and vice versa
- we use qubits to direct light from a single source as to not let light from external sources affect out results

## materials

- we use a micro pipuet's and blue tips - push plunger to first stop, insirt tip, release plunger
- ret rid of tips in yewllow bucket by pressing discard tip leaver on pippette
- don't touch flat sides of qubits
- click the blank buttoin when inserting the blank(basically a control)
- the blank has broth and ONPG and the negative control has broth
- a positive control would be one where we know there is a known faecal coliform inside

# Part B

- the mpn test (most probable number test)
- is a direct method
- done on agar plates
- type of bacteria is determined by color of colonies (faecal coliforms are red/pink)

## materials

- add 100microliters of solution
- yellow tips
- after solution is on agar plates use spreaders
- move spreader in single motion, rotating the agar plate
- check spreader in yellow bucket
- **scientific notation** 120000 will be expressed as 1.2 & 10^5 becuase the decimal point moves back 5 paces
- the formula will be:

```

concentration(cfu/ml) = number of colonies counted on plate / [volume plated (ml) * dilution factor of plate]

example:

concentration(cfu/ml) = 32 / [0.1 (10^-1) * 0.1 (10^-1)]

```

## gram staining

- a method used to classify bacteria based on their stain reaction
- is based on cell wall composition
- a **thick layer of peptidoglycan = positive**
- positive appears purple
- a **thin layer of peptiglycan = negative**
- negative appears pink

## cellular morphology

- round or long
- round = coccus or diplococci if there are 2
- long = bacillius or diplobacilli
