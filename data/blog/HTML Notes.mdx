# HTML

headings - <h1> Heading </h1>

progressive size change <h1> <h2> <h3>... ~ <h6>

breaks in txt - <br>

Anatomy of HTML tags

opening tag <h1>
closing tag </h1>
between them is teh contents to which the tags are applied ~ <h1> Heading </h1>

Self closing tags <br> that have no closing tag

Horizontal rule <hr> which add lines above and below the enclosed text

HTML atributes are contained within elements and adjust those element

Example:

<hr size = "3"> or <hr size = 3> "which would increase the size of the horizontal line"

other attributes for <hr> include:

<hr align = "value"> - "sets the allignment of the rule on the page "
<hr noshade = value> -  "sets the rule to have no shading "
<hr color = value (hexidecimal)>
<hr width = value>

<element attribute = value attribute...>

changing the position of text:

<centre> closing tag </centre> " moves all text in between the tags to the centre of the "

" " encloses text and doesn't interpret it into the code - essentially adding a comment

HTML sites

Boilerplate code " repeating code that acts as a basic structure for the rest of the site "

HTML:

<html> is the doctype

everything between the <html> and </html> tags will be read as html

this typically consist of a <head> and a <body>

<head> hold information about the browser

inside the head tags <head> and </head> will be the <title></title> which is the title of the page

<meta> gives extra awssociated data to the elements

<meta charset = utf-8> says that everything within the text document is encoded in utf8

encoding is unique to diffrent languages and can become jumbled if the wrong encoding is used to translate an language that uses a diffrent one

<utf-8> is the standard coding to use when codnig using html 5

this is becuase <meta charset = utf-8> includes all symbols from unicode including international symbols

In <body></body> we can write <p> for a paragraph line

when writing <p>, to italizise word or apragraphs write <em></em>

<i></i> can be used to do the same thing by only slants the text

similarly the <strong></strong> and <b></b> mak e text bold however <strong></strong> is rpefered as it behaviours similarly to <em></em>

List:

there are three types of list

unordered list <ul></ul>

ordered list <ol></ol>

discription list <dl></dl>

between these takes will be the items which fall between <li></li> tags - " this only applies to unordered and ordered lsit " " this was a lie "

for description list, you will have <dl></dl> and whitin these you will have <dt></dt> which implemnts a term and under that will be <dd></dd> which is the following decription.

I lied before:

uoi can just make a list within a list which looks like this:

<ul>
  <li></li>
  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

For ordered list you can also change the starting order by writing <ol type = i> the attribute of "type" being to change the order

u can combine all the types of list

To insert images within the piece we would use the image html element which is <img>

from here we need the attribute of source <img src> which is the image displayed

then the value would be a url are or a local image

for easier access to iamges we can create a file within the file of personalise website that would look like this

<img src = image/gangsta.png>

you may need to be more precise " an easy way to get around this is to copy image pathway "

<img src = "C:\Users\MSI\Downloads\Gansta-modified.png" alt = "gangsta type sht" >

<a></a> a tags or anchor tag amkes hyperliks to websites, emails, phones etc...

example to website

<a href = https://devdocs.io/html/element/a> helpful website </a> " the "helpful website" will be what the hyperlink appears as "

Tables:

tables are seperated into table rows and table cells

They are also seperated into a head, a body and a foot that the cells are contained within expressed through <thead></thead> and <tbody></tbody> and <tfoot></tfoot>

table rows are defined as <tr>

table cells are contained within te table rows and are defined as <td>

the title head <thead></thead> acts as the top row titles

in the <thead> you create table header cells or <th>

Tables can have attributes howeer they are bit reccomended as CSS is more used for stylising appearence

Forms:

use <form></forms>

Forms have many attributes

Forms are used for collecting data however cannot be fully utilised without javascript

<form action = URL> this URL will be the site that the user is taken to once the inputs are saved 
<form method = value> is the method information from the form is submitted as
<form enctype = value> this makes the language iof the form easier to read

forms need lables which are writen as <label> value </label>

as well as the value there will also be a section to input data which is described as:

<input name = "submitted name" autocomplete = name />

the attributes of "name" and "autocomplete" describe what the data is and whether it can be auto completed or not

for "yes" or "no" forms, they are described as such:

they have a legend <legend></legend> which is essentially a label but a question instead

this will be contatined within the <fieldset></fieldset> element which groups HTML forms with a nested legend " a statment or question at the top of the nest "

for fieldset forms, input is decribed as such

<input type = radio> there are many diffrent types of inputs, for field set use "radio"
<input name = checklist id = checklist> name and id are unique identifiers to link the imput to the label " they also act to seperate text "
and of course <input value = "value" > which adds a value to the said check

making wirtten forms ivolves the elemnt <textarea> which creastes a box for writing

under it should be a submission button or some form of saving e.g <input type = botton value = save> or <input type = submit>
