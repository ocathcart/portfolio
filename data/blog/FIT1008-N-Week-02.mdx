# Abstract Data Types (ADT's) and Stack ADT

## Data types

- Common concepts in lower level langagues
- Refers to a classification that determines:

  - The possible **values** for that types
  - The **meaning** of those values
  - The **operations** that can be done on them
  - The way those values are **implemented**

An **abstract** data type:

    - provides information regarding:

        - The possible values of the type and their meaning
        - The operations that can be done on them

    - But **not** on its implementation, i.e how:

        - The values are stored
        - The operations are implemented

    - Users interact with the data **only** through the provided operations

Advantages of ADT:

    - Build programs without knowing their implementation
    - The implementation can change without affecting you
    - If several ADT's available, you could easily use any
    - Diffrent compilers can use diffrent implementation'

## DATA Structure:

- At some point we must give ADT's an implementation

- Some ADT's (like Lists) contain several data fields

- That is what a **data structure** provides

  - A particular way in which data **is physically** organised (so that certain operations can be performed efficiently)

# Stack ADT's

what makes a stack?:

    - Its operations follow the Last in First Out (LIFO) processed

        - The last element to be added, is the first to be deleted

    - Access to any other element is uneccesary (and thus not allowed)

        - If you need to access another element, choose a diffrent ADT

The key operations are:

    - Stack: create a stack
    - Push: add an item to the top
    - Pop: Take an item off the top
    - Loo at the item on the Top/Peek:
    - what is its Length
    - is the stack Empty
    - is the stack Full
    - Clear: empty the stack

the first step for creating stacks is creating a base stack class:

we do this by

```py
from typing import TypeVar, Generic # imports two types from typing
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

T = TypeVar('T') # uses TypeVar to create type variable T; will represent the type of the elements

class Stack (ABC, Generic[T]): # generic let's us to use type vars, ABC idicates that the class is abstracted
     def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.length = 0

    @abstractmethod # indicates the method is abstract, and this its implementation is not defined
    def push(self,item:T) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def pop(self) -> T:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def peek(self) -> T:
        pass

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return self.length
    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self) == 0

    @abstractmethod
    def is_full(self) -> bool:
        pass
    def clear(self) -> None:
        self.length = 0
```

the big O complexiy is equal to O(1)

# Stack Arrays

stacks implemented with arrays often use two elements:

    - An array to store the items in the order which they arrive

        - Then length of the array indicates the maximum capacity of the stack

    - An interger indicating the first empyt space in the array

Incariants of such implementation:

    - Valid data appears in the 0...length-1 position od the array

    - Element at the top of the stack is the element in position length-1

Basic ideas with arrays:

- Create a new stack: initiially no elements in the array
  - Max xapacity = 6
  - length = 0 - 5

implementation:

```py
from typing import TypeVar, Generic # imports two types from typing
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

T = TypeVar('T') # uses TypeVar to create type variable T; will represent the type of the elements

class Stack (ABC, Generic[T]): # generic let's us to use type vars, ABC idicates that the class is abstracted
     def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.length = 0

    @abstractmethod # indicates the method is abstract, and this its implementation is not defined
    def push(self,item:T) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def pop(self) -> T:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def peek(self) -> T:
        pass

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return self.length
    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self) == 0

    @abstractmethod
    def is_full(self) -> bool:
        pass
    def clear(self) -> None:
        self.length = 0

class ArrayStack(Stack):

```

# Implementing the Stack ADT array:

- Add a class `ArrayStack` derived from `Stack` that implemnts all methods

- Download `referential_array.py` fom moodle

- Then import the `ArrayR` class adding to your moduke the line

```py
from referential_array import ArrayR
```

from then on you can use it as such

    - **Create** an array of a given size `array = ArrayR(4)`
    - **Access** the element at a given **postion**. `element = array[2]`
    - **Set** the value of the element at a given **position**. `array[3] = value`
    - Obtain its **length**. `length = len(array)`

the implementation will look like this

```py

from referential_array import ArrayR
from abstract_stack import Stack, T

class ArrayStack(Stack[T]):
    MIN_CAPACITY = 1 # minimum capacity of the array. Createsd as class variable, since it is the same for all objects.

    def __init__(self, max_capacity: int) -> None: #O(max_capacity)
        Stack.__init__(self) # uses the implementation of the parent class # O(1)
        self.array = ArrayR(max(self.MIN_CAPACITY, max_capacity))

    def is_full(self) -> bool:
        return len(self) == len(self.array) # O(1)

```

# Stack implementated with arrays:

implementing the push method:

```py
def push(self, item: T) -> None:
   if self.is_full():
       raise Exception("Stack is full")

   self.array[len(self)] = item
   self.length += 1 #O(1)
```

implementing pop:

```py
def pop(self) -> T:
   if self.is_empty():
       raise Exception ("Stack is empty")

   self.length -= 1
   return self.array[self.length] #O(1)
```

implementing peek:

```py
def peek(self) -> T:
   if self.is_empty():
       raise Exception("Stack is empty")

   return self.array[self.length-1]
```

# Using our ArrayStack

reversing a array:

- given array `a b c d`

```py
from referential_array import ArrayR
from abstract_stack import Stack, T

class ArrayStack(Stack[T]):
    MIN_CAPACITY = 1 # minimum capacity of the array. Createsd as class variable, since it is the same for all objects.

    def __init__(self, max_capacity: int) -> None: #O(max_capacity)
        Stack.__init__(self) # uses the implementation of the parent class # O(1)
        self.array = ArrayR(max(self.MIN_CAPACITY, max_capacity))

    def is_full(self) -> bool:
        return len(self) == len(self.array) # O(1)

    def push(self, item: T) -> None:
        if self.is_full():
            raise Exception("Stack is full")

        self.array[len(self)] = item
        self.length += 1 #O(1)

     def pop(self) -> T:
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception ("Stack is empty")

        self.length -= 1
        return self.array[self.length] #O(1)

    def peek(self) -> T:
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("Stack is empty")

        return self.array[self.length-1]

-----------------------------------------------------

my_stack.push('a') # a
my_stack.push('b') # a b
my_stack.push('c') # a b c
my_stack.push('d') # a b c d

my_stack.pop() # d
my_stack.pop() # d c
my_stack.pop() # d c b
my_stack.pop() # d c b a
