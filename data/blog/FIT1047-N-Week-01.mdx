# What is a computer?

Basiaclly all modern computers:

    - are **digital** (work with 0's and 1's)

    - use **eletrical circuits** to perfom calculations and data manipulation

    - are controlled by **stored programs**

most:

    - Have a Centrqal Processing Unit (**CPU**)

    - Random Access Memory (**RAM**)

    - Input?Output device (**I/O**)

Many are connected to a network

Samllest unit:

    - is a **bit** which is just a single 1 or 0

Conventionally 8 bits are contanied within a **byte**, And a **word** is a block of bits of a particular size, depending on the concret computer architecture
Most modern CPS's havea **word size** of either 32 or 64 bits

Standar Sizing units are as such:

    Bit **1**
    Byte **8 Bits**
    Word **32 Bits**
    Kil **1024 Bytes**
    Mega **1024 Kil**
    Giga **1024 Mega**
    Tera **1024 Giga**
    Peta **1024 Tera**

# Nunber Systems

number systems are a way of representing numbers using digits

The decimal system for example is:

    - Where each number is represented by a sequence of digits
    - Each digit is worth a multiple of a power of 10

Computers use **binary numbers** (base 2 instead of base 10)

basically to read binary:

    - read from the right to left
    - the right most number will be 2 to the power of what ever position it is in times the 1 or 0 that is associated with that position
    - then these are added up

    - to convert a decimal to binary, divide by 2, if there is a remained, then place a 1.
    - place fromk left to right until there no numbers are left

using **n** bits we can represent 2^**n** diffrent numbers

# Signed Intergers

just use another bit to represent the sign, This is called **Sign and Magnitude** representation.

## 2's complement properties

    - Leftmost bit is stil indeicating the sign
    - Negative 1 is always 111...1
    - The smallest negative number is 100...0
    - The argest postivive number is 011...1
    - regular long addition works

overflows:

    - if two positive numbwers ass up to a neagtive number (leading 1), we have an overflows

    - If two negative numbers add up to a positive number (eading 0) we have an overflow

# Floating Point Numbers

using intergers, we **scale** both values so0 they are whole numbers
or we coulder **round** to the nearest interger, but not likely

    - representing these numbers, big numbers or small decimals, we can use two binary numbers, the **significand** (s) and the **exponent** (e) and a **extra sign bit**

    - both s and e have fixed size (52 bits for s and 11 bits for e is defined in the IEEE 745 standard)

    - Now we can represent very small and very large numbers

    - Computers have special hardward for floating point calculations

example:

```

6.25 in binary would be as such

110.01

as:

    1 * 2^2 = 4
    1 * 2^1 = 2
    0 * 2^0 = 0
    .
    0 * 2^-1 = 0
    1 * 2^-2 = 0.25

so 4 + 2 + 0 . 0 + 0.25

we normalise this number so that it starts with 1.:

    1.1001 * 2^2 SN (scientific notation)

the significand is s = 001001.

```

Floating opint numbers have **limited precision**

in many computers, floating point numbers use 64 bis, but intergers also use 64 bits.

Floating point numbers use **rounding**

# Representing Text

ASCII stands for The American Standard Code for Information Interchange

It maps all character required for English texts, plus the numbers 0-9 and some extra symbols

- Characters are encoted into numbers

- ASCII and Unicode are the most common encodings

- Unicode can represent over a million diffrent characters

- Texts are stored and transferred as sequences of encoded characters

```

what is "hello world!" in binary?

104 101 108 108 111 032 119 111 114 108 100
h   e   l   l   o    _  w   o   r   l   d

```

# Transistors and Gates

digital electronis work with two diffrent states: on (high) or off (low)

**Transistors** are made from semiconductor materials such as silicon or germanium

a **gate** is an eletronic circuit that performs a cimple **computation**

Gates have **inputs** and **outputs** that can be high or low, representing ones and zeros

**not** gate:

    - if input is low, the output is high

    - if input is high, output is low

**or** gate:

    - if either two input high, output is high

    - if both input low, output is low

**and** gate:

    - if both input high, out high

    - if both input low, output low
