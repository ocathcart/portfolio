# Computer Architecture

![computer](/static/images/FIT1047/computer_arch01.jpg)
main components:

    - Computer

        - Arithmetic/Logic unit (ALU)

            - Interger addition, subtraction, multiplication
            - Boolean operations, AND, OR, NOT...

        - Register

            - Very **fast memory** inside the CPU
            - Store temporary results
            - Help move data around (from/to memory and I/O)

        - Control

            - Responsible for **executing** the program
            - **Switches** all other somponents on/off according to induvidual **instructions**

    - Memory

        - Stores both **data** and program **code**
        - Connceted to CPU via a **bus**
        - CPU can read and write words from/to memory

    - Input / Output devices

        - Anything else connected to the computer
        - Keyboard, touch screen, mouse, sounds, GPS, gyroscope, printer, hard disk, USB...

# Machine Architecture that is Really Intuituve and Easy (MARIE)

- Very simple machine simulator
- Simulates all the components: CPU, memory, input/output
- All data and instructions are 16 bit words

# Combinational Circuits

most basic circuits:

The output is a **function** of the inputs, Clearly useful for arithmetic and logic operations

### adding two one-bit numbers is easy:

| X + Y | RESULT |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0 + 0 | 00     |
| 0 + 1 | 01     |
| 1 + 0 | 01     |
| 1 + 1 | 10     |

represented here:

### Adding three one-bit numbers:

| X + Y + Carry-in | RESULT |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| 0 + 0 + 0        | 00     |
| 0 + 0 + 1        | 01     |
| 0 + 1 + 0        | 01     |
| 0 + 1 + 1        | 10     |
| 1 + 0 + 0        | 01     |
| 1 + 0 + 1        | 10     |
| 1 + 1 + 0        | 10     |
| 1 + 1 + 1        | 11     |

Boolean Logic:

### Ripple Carry Adder

Combine _n_ full adders to add two _n_-bit numbers:

## Decoder:

- Activate one output based on a binary number

| A   | B   | D0  | D1  | D2  | D3  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |

## Multiplexer (MUX):

- selects one of several inputs
- uses a decoder to select, AND gates to activate, and an OR gate to combine

# Arithmetic-Logic units

ALU:

    - Fundamental building block of CPUs
    - Moder CPUs (and GPUs) contain multiple ALUs
    - Implements basic **computations**:

        - Interger addition, subtraction
        - Comparisons
        - Bitwise Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT)
        - Shifting

ALU Circuit:

    - Inputs:

        - two n-bit **operands**
        - op-code (which operation to perform)

    - Output: n-bit **result** and **status** (oberflow? error?)
    - How to decide which operation to perform

        - Perform all in **parallel**
        - Then choose the desired result based on op-code
