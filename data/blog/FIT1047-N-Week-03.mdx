# Computer Architecture

![computer](/static/images/FIT1047/computer_arch01.jpg)
main components:

    - Computer

        - Arithmetic/Logic unit (ALU)

            - Interger addition, subtraction, multiplication
            - Boolean operations, AND, OR, NOT...

        - Register

            - Very **fast memory** inside the CPU
            - Store temporary results
            - Help move data around (from/to memory and I/O)

        - Control

            - Responsible for **executing** the program
            - **Switches** all other somponents on/off according to induvidual **instructions**

    - Memory

        - Stores both **data** and program **code**
        - Connceted to CPU via a **bus**
        - CPU can read and write words from/to memory

    - Input / Output devices

        - Anything else connected to the computer
        - Keyboard, touch screen, mouse, sounds, GPS, gyroscope, printer, hard disk, USB...

# Machine Architecture that is Really Intuituve and Easy (MARIE)

- Very simple machine simulator
- Simulates all the components: CPU, memory, input/output
- All data and instructions are 16 bit words

# Combinational Circuits

most basic circuits:

The output is a **function** of the inputs, Clearly useful for arithmetic and logic operations

### adding two one-bit numbers is easy:

| X + Y | RESULT |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0 + 0 | 00     |
| 0 + 1 | 01     |
| 1 + 0 | 01     |
| 1 + 1 | 10     |

represented here:

### Adding three one-bit numbers:

| X + Y + Carry-in | RESULT |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| 0 + 0 + 0        | 00     |
| 0 + 0 + 1        | 01     |
| 0 + 1 + 0        | 01     |
| 0 + 1 + 1        | 10     |
| 1 + 0 + 0        | 01     |
| 1 + 0 + 1        | 10     |
| 1 + 1 + 0        | 10     |
| 1 + 1 + 1        | 11     |

## Decoder:

- Activate one output based on a binary number

| A   | B   | D0  | D1  | D2  | D3  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |

![decoder](/static/images/FIT1047/deconder.jpg)

## Multiplexer (MUX):

- selects one of several inputs
- uses a decoder to select, AND gates to activate, and an OR gate to combine

![multiplexer](/static/images/FIT1047/multiplexer.jpg)

# Arithmetic-Logic units

ALU:

    - Fundamental building block of CPUs
    - Moder CPUs (and GPUs) contain multiple ALUs
    - Implements basic **computations**:

        - Interger addition, subtraction
        - Comparisons
        - Bitwise Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT)
        - Shifting

ALU Circuit:

    - Inputs:

        - two n-bit **operands**
        - op-code (which operation to perform)

    - Output: n-bit **result** and **status** (oberflow? error?)
    - How to decide which operation to perform

        - Perform all in **parallel**
        - Then choose the desired result based on op-code

# Programs

computers are **programmable**, the programming can be **changed**, that's what makes them useful.

examples:
Python

```py
import sys
name = sys.argc[1]
print('hello, ' + name + '!')
```

C++

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
    std: :cout << "hello world" << std: :endl;
    return 0;
}
```

java

```java
public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(string[] args){
        System.out.println("hello, World");
    }
}
```

the CPU can't execute these programs directly, they need to be **compiled** or **interpreted** - sometimes both! CPUs can only execute **machine code**

## Machine code

- A very simple computer language
- Diffrent for each computer architecture

  - diffrent code for your phone, your laptop, your smart lights

- Machine code programs are

  - Sequence of instructions
  - Stored in memory
  - Each instruction is one or more words

## Instruction Set Architecture

The set of instructions that a particular type of CPU understands is called its **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**

What kinds of instructions?:

    - Do some **maths** (add, subtract, multiply, compare)
    - **Move** data between memory, register and I/O
    - Execute **conditionals** and **loops**

# MARIE programming

## MARIE architecture

![marie_architecture](/static/images/FIT1047/mariearch.jpg)

## MARIE machine model

- Each memory location (“box”) holds a 16-bit word

  - The CPU has only one general purpose register:

- The accumulator AC

  - Each instruction is a 16-bit word composed of

    - a 4-bit op-code (what to do)
    - and a 12-bit address (which memory location to use)

  - Example: 0001000110001110
    - 0001 Op-code: LOAD
    - 000110001110 Address: 18E(16)

## MARIE instructions

# Control

## The marie architecture

![more_marie_arch](/static/images/FIT1047/mariearch2.jpg)

## The control unit

- Needs to **coordinate** registers, ALU and memory based on the **program**

- For each instruction, the control unit performs three steps:
  - Fetch the next instruction from memory
  - Decode the instruction
  - Execute the instruction

## The Clock

- Computers can't execute each step as quickly as possible
- Each step needs to take a fixed amount of time
- This time is determined by the **clock**
  - An _oscillator circuit_: output constantly changes from 0 to 1 and back
  - Each such change is called a **clock cycle**
  - Number of cycles per second: Hertz (Hz)
  - Typical clock speeds: billions of cycles per second (GHz)

**What happens during one clock cycle?**

- Depends a lot on the CPU
- Some instructions only need a single cycle
- Some may need hundreds! (E.g. loading from main memory)
- We will make a simplifying assumption:
  - Each move between registers, ALU, memory takes one cycle

## Control signals

Each control signal is a “wire” inside the CPU

- Which register to read/write?
- Whether to read or write from/to the memory?
- Which operation to perform in the ALU?

Which signals need to be on and off is determined by

- The current step (fetch, decode, execute)
- The current instruction

## Register Transfer Language (RTL)

Let's break down instructions into even smaller steps:

- The CPU performs one step per clock cycle.
- Each step transfers data between registers and/or memory.

ex:

![RTL_fetch](/static/images/FIT1047/RTLfetch.jpg)

![RTL_decode](/static/images/FIT1047/RTLdecode.jpg)

![RTL_execute](/static/images/FIT1047/RTLexecute.jpg)

complete:

```
1. MAR <- PC
2. MBR <-M[MAR]
3. IR <- MBR
4. PC <- PC+1
5. MAR <- x
6. MBR <- M[MAR]
7. AC <- AC + MBR
```

## Control Signals and RTL

Each RTL step determines which control signals to switch on and off.
Example: `MBR` ← `M[MAR]`
(load memory value from address stored in MAR into MBR)

- Switch register file to write into MBR
- Switch memory into read mode

Each RTL step determines which control signals to switch on
and off.

Example: `AC` ← `AC` + `MBR`
(add value in MBR to value stored in AC, store result in AC)

- Switch register file to read from AC
- Switch register file to write into AC
- Switch ALU into “Add” mode (ALU always reads one operand from MBR)
