# introduction

a man bets his friend 10$ that the next person they ask will know how to program. the nest person they see walking on the street is wearing a 'hello world' tshirt. This is represented as a square cotaining two circles which slight overlap:

circle **P** is the set of people who code,which is pretty small compared to the size of the square

when u see someone wearing the 'hello world' shirt u are no longer at a random point in the rectangle, but instead the cirtcle **T** where there is still a small chance they are not a programmer.
