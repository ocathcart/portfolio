# Memory

- Stores both **data** and program **code**
- connected to CPU via a **bus**
- CPU can read and write words from/to Memory

memory is **external to the CPU** Think of it as a sequemce of boxes.
![memory](/static/images/FIT1047/memory.jpg)
Each box contains a value
This could be a machine code instruction, or data
we give each box an address: the number of the box, starting from 0.

## What do we sotre in memory

![memory_storage](/static/images/FIT1047/Memory_storage.jpg)

## Addressing

most architectures store **one byte per memory location**:
Each byte has its own adress.
Theses architectures are called **byte-addressable**

Some architectures (including MARIE) store **one word per location**:
Each word has its own address
This is called **word-addressable**

## how much memory can we address

Easy: n bits can represent 2^n diffrent addresses!

- MARIE addresses are 12 bits long
- That's 2^12 diffrent addresses
- MARIE is word-addressable, each address contains a 12-bit (2-byte) value
- so MARIE can address 2 \* 2^12bytes = 8,192 bytes = 8 kibibyte of memory

## Random Access Memory (RAM)

- Computer main memory is often called RAM
- Random assecc mean we can read and write data at any address, in any order
- In contrast to storage such as magnetic tapes, disks, DVD's etc..
  - disks read/write heads need to move to the right place

## RAM module Addressing

example address(17 bit):

    - 01011000010010011

    - 010 row 2
    - 110 column 6
    - 00010010011 select byte

# The memory hierachy

## The memory Bottleneck

Registers are very, very fast:

    - can be rad/written as part of a single CPU cycle
    - Main memory is up to 100x slower
    - consider this code for doubling the value stored at address `1A0`:

```
Load 1A0
Add 1A0
Store 1A0
```

## Caching

A **chache** sits between the register and the RAM:

- Additional memory in the CPU
- Faster than RAM, slower than register
- Smaller than RAM, larger than registers
- Keeps recently loaded values close to the CPU

- Fully implemented in hardware
- Transparent for the program:

  - `Load 1A0` load from cache if possible, from RAM otherwise
  - `Store 1A0` may store only to chache (for later tansfer to RAM) or both to cache and RAM, or only to RAM

## Caching Tricks

- programs often access consecutive addresses e.g:

  - Searching through some text form start to finish
  - making all pixes in an image prighter
  - playing video or audio data

- When you `load` a value that's not yet in the chache, the cache will already load the next few values as well
- When cache is full, the oldest values are thrown out,

  - Less likely to need those again

## What makes cachin tricky

- "Cache misses" can make a program go 100x slower!
- Performance of code

  - may be difficult to predict
  - may depend heavily on CPU chace architecture

- High-performance code may have to be written with cache in Mind
- Remember: programs themselves are stored in RAM (and therefor also cache)

## dealing with big data

What to do when you don't have enough RAM?
**Swapping**

- Write unused parts of RAM to disk
- Read back when required
- Almost opposite of caching
- Implemented by combination of hardware and operating system (virtual _memory_, more _later_)

## Modern Memory Hierarchy

![modernmemoryhierachy](/static/images/FIT1047/modmemhie.jpg)

# Indirect Addressing

## Addresses in MARIE

Many MARIE instructions include an **address**:

`Store X` Store current AC into memory at address X
`Load X` Load value from memory at address X into AC
`Add X` Add value at memory address X to current AC
`Jump X` Continue execution at address X
**Problem**: Address X is fixed in the program! Not very flexible.

## Indirect addressing

Use the **address stored at address** `X`.
Example:
`Load X`:
Load value v from memory at address X into AC.
Result: `AC = v`.
`LoadI X`:
Load value `v` from address `X`, then **load value w from address v** into AC.
Result: `AC = w`

## Direct addressing

```
Load 100
Output
Load 101
Output
Load 102
Output
Load 103
Output
Load 104
Output
Load 105
Output
```

## Indirect addressing

```
LoadI 200
Output
Load 200
Add One
Store 200
```

# Array and Strings

## Arrays

Programs need to deal with **sequences** of data all the time:
Text is a sequence of characters, an image is a sequence of
rows of pixels (and a row is a sequence of pixels), a video is
a sequence of images, …
The most common implementation of lists or sequences is an
**array**: data stored at consecutive addresses in memory.

## Adding up an array of numbers

First example:
We have an array of numbers in memory.
The address of the first number is stored at `Start`.
The length of the array is stored at `Length`.
We have to compute and output the sum of all numbers.

```
Loop, Load Temp
  AddI Start
  Store Temp

  Load Start
  Add One
  Store Start

  Load Length
  Subt One
  Store Length
  SkipCond 400
  Jump Loop

  Load Temp
  Output
  Halt
```

```
Start, Adr Array
Length, DEC 5

Array, DEC 1
 DEC 2
 DEC 3
 DEC 4
 DEC 5

One, DEC 1
Temp, Dec 0
```

## Strings

A string is a sequence of characters (e.g. ASCII or Unicode).
In a common representation, instead of storing the length of
the string, the end is marked by a 0 (zero) character.
Let's output a string that's 0-terminated.

sample code:

```MARIE

Loop, LoadI StringStart
  SkipCond 800
  Halt
  Output
  Load StringStart
  Add One
  Store StringStart
  Jump Loop

StringStart, Adr String

String, HEX 46
  HEX 49
  HEX 54
  HEX 31
  HEX 30
  HEX 34
  HEX 37
  HEX 0 / end of string

One, DEC 1
```

# Subroutines

Also known as **procedures**, **functions**, **methods**, …
A piece of code that:

- has a well-defined **functionality**
- needs to be executed **often**
- we can call, passing **arguments** to it
- **returns** to where it was called from

## Subroutiens in machine code

ISAs provide special instructions for:

- jumping to a subroutine, but remembering the current PC
- returning from a subroutine to the remembered PC

In MARIE:

- `JnS X`:
  - Store PC at address `X`, then jump to `X+1`
- `JumpI X`:
  - Jump to address stored at address `X`

## Double subroutine

```
# Main program

Input
Store DoubleArg
JnS Double
Load DoubleArg
Output
Halt
```

```
/ Subroutine

DoubleArg, DEC 0
Double, HEX 0
  Load DoubleArg
  Add DoubleArg
  Store DoubleArg
  JumpI Double
```

## Output string subroutine

```
OutputStringArg, HEX 0
OutputString, HEX 0
Loop, LoadI OutputStringArg
      SkipCond 800
      JumpI OutputString
      Output
      Load OutputStringArg
      Add One
      Store OutputStringArg
      Jump Loop
```
