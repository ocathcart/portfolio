# Boolean Logic

Named after George Boole

Logic is a formal system for **writing down** and **evaluating statements**

**Boolean logic** is simple baseed on two truth values:

    - True

    - False

Any statement is either true or false

Not all statements have that property

basic concepts:

    - Variables written e.g X, Y, Z

    - Expression created from variables and operators.

    - Common operators: AND, OR, NOT

        - and can be written as such: X AND Y, XY, X^Y, X dot Y
        - or can also be written diffrently: X OR Y, X+Y, XvY
        - NOT can be written as such: NOT X, X(dash above)

mathematical example:

```py
F(X,Y,Z) = X and not Z or Y = ((not X) and Z) + Y

# X = trains are running
# Z it raining
# Y can borrow the car
```

# Simple Circuits

logic -> circuits
