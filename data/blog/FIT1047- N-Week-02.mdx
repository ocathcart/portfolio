# Boolean Logic

Named after George Boole

Logic is a formal system for **writing down** and **evaluating statements**

**Boolean logic** is simple baseed on two truth values:

    - True

    - False

Any statement is either true or false

Not all statements have that property

basic concepts:

    - Variables written e.g X, Y, Z

    - Expression created from variables and operators.

    - Common operators: AND, OR, NOT

        - and can be written as such: X AND Y, XY, X^Y, X dot Y
        - or can also be written diffrently: X OR Y, X+Y, XvY
        - NOT can be written as such: NOT X, X(dash above)

Logic:

AND:

| X   | Y   | XY  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

OR:

| X   | Y   | X+Y |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

mathematical example:

```py
F(X,Y,Z) = X and not Z or Y = ((not X) and Z) + Y

# X = trains are running
# Z it raining
# Y can borrow the car
```

this can also be represented as:

![XYZ_sequence][/static/images/fit1047/xyzsequence.jpg]

this is called a circuit, a chip that containg multiple circuits is called an intergrated citcuits

| X   | Y   | Z   | NOT Z | XZ OR Y |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1     | 1       |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1     | 0       |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1     | 0       |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0     | 1       |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1     | 1       |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0     | 1       |

# Simple Circuits

logic -> circuits

### Logic gates

![Boolean_logic_circuit](/static/images/FIT1047/Boolean_Logic_Circuits.jpg)

A OR B is the same as NOT (NOT A AND NOT B)

    - basically we don't need OR gates

| X   | Y   | ?   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

this table represents the NOT AND gate:

![NOT_AND_gate](/static/images/FIT1047/NOTANDsymbol.jpg)

this is called a _Universal gate_ (NAND (NOT AND))

     - A universal gate is one that can represent all other boolean circuits

```
(X NAND Y)  NAND ( X NAND Y) = X AND Y
```

represented as a citcuit:

### XOR circuits

Logic:

| X   | Y   | X+Y | N(X+Y) | XY  |
| --- | --- | --- | ------ | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1      | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1      | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1      | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0      | 0   |

# From Functions to Circuits

A truth table **uniquely defines** a Boolean function

### The Sum-Of-Products method:

we want to find an expression that's True exactly for the rows where `F(X,Y,Z) = 1` from this truth table:

| X   | Y   | Z   | F(X,Y,Z) |
| --- | --- | --- | -------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0        |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0        |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1        |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0        |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1        |

from this table we can gather:

As a diagram this is represented as such:

# Boolean Algebra

they help us come up with a small boolean function resulting in a:

    - more efficient circuit
    - faster citcuit
    - etc...

the laws od equivalance are as such:

| /                 | "AND" form  | "OR" form    |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Identify          | 1X = X      | 0 + X = X    |
| Null              | 0X = 0      | 1 + X = 1    |
| Idempotent        | XX = X      | X + X = X    |
| Inverse           | X N(X) = 0  | X + N(X) = 1 |
| Double Complement | N(N(X)) = X |              |
