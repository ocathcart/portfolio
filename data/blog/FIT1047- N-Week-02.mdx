# Boolean Logic

Named after George Boole

Logic is a formal system for **writing down** and **evaluating statements**

**Boolean logic** is simple baseed on two truth values:

    - True

    - False

Any statement is either true or false

Not all statements have that property

basic concepts:

    - Variables written e.g X, Y, Z

    - Expression created from variables and operators.

    - Common operators: AND, OR, NOT

        - and can be written as such: X AND Y, XY, X^Y, X dot Y
        - or can also be written diffrently: X OR Y, X+Y, XvY
        - NOT can be written as such: NOT X, X(dash above)

Logic:

AND:

| X   | Y   | XY  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

OR:

| X   | Y   | X+Y |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

mathematical example:

```py
F(X,Y,Z) = X and not Z or Y = ((not X) and Z) + Y

# X = trains are running
# Z it raining
# Y can borrow the car
```

this can also be represented as:

![XYZ_sequence][/static/images/fit1047/xyzsequence.jpg]

this is called a circuit, a chip that containg multiple circuits is called an intergrated citcuits

| X   | Y   | Z   | NOT Z | XZ OR Y |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1     | 1       |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1     | 0       |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1     | 0       |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0     | 1       |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1     | 1       |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0     | 1       |

# Simple Circuits

logic -> circuits

### Logic gates

![Boolean_logic_circuit](/static/images/FIT1047/Boolean_Logic_Circuits.jpg)

A OR B is the same as NOT (NOT A AND NOT B)

    - basically we don't need OR gates

| X   | Y   | ?   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

this table represents the NOT AND gate:

![NOT_AND_gate](/static/images/FIT1047/NOTANDsymbol.jpg)

this is called a _Universal gate_ (NAND (NOT AND))

     - A universal gate is one that can represent all other boolean circuits

```
(X NAND Y)  NAND ( X NAND Y) = X AND Y
```

represented as a citcuit:

### XOR circuits

Logic:

| X   | Y   | X+Y | N(X+Y) | XY  |
| --- | --- | --- | ------ | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1      | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1      | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1      | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0      | 0   |

# From Functions to Circuits

A truth table **uniquely defines** a Boolean function

### The Sum-Of-Products method:

we want to find an expression that's True exactly for the rows where `F(X,Y,Z) = 1` from this truth table:

| X   | Y   | Z   | F(X,Y,Z) |
| --- | --- | --- | -------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0        |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0        |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1        |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0        |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1        |

from this table we can gather:

# Boolean Algebra

they help us come up with a small boolean function resulting in a:

    - more efficient circuit
    - faster citcuit
    - etc...

the laws od equivalance are as such:

| /                 | "AND" form              | "OR" form                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Identify          | 1X = X                  | 0 + X = X                 |
| Null              | 0X = 0                  | 1 + X = 1                 |
| Idempotent        | XX = X                  | X + X = X                 |
| Inverse           | X N(X) = 0              | X + N(X) = 1              |
| Double Complement | N(N(X)) = X             |                           |
| Communative       | XY = YX                 | X + Y = Y + X             |
| Associative       | (XY)Z = X(YZ)           | (X + Y) + Z = X + (Y + Z) |
| Distributive      | X + YZ = (X + Y)(X + Z) | X(Y + Z) = XY + XZ        |
| Absorption        | X(X + Y) = X            | X + XY = X                |
| DoMorgand's       | N(X) N(Y) = N(X) + N(Y) | N(X) N(+) N(Y) = N(XY)    |

Application of simplifying:

```
N(AB)A + A N(B)
= (N(A) + N(B))A + A N(B) - DeMorgan's law
= A(N(A) + N(B)) + A N(B) - Communative law
= A N(A) + A N(B) + A N(B) - Distruptive law
= 0 + A N(B) + A N(B) - Inverse law
= A N(B) + A N(B) - Identity law
= A N(B) - idempotent law
```

# Karnaugh Maps

is a algorithmic approach to producting simpler circuits

    - manual but systematic

    - best for as most 6 variables

    - will produce the sum-of-products

normal representation:

| X   | Y   | Z   | F(X,Y,Z) |
| --- | --- | --- | -------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0        |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0        |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1        |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0        |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1        |

K-Map representation:

| XY \ Z | 0   | 1   |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| 00     | 0   | 0   |
| 01     | 1   | 1   |
| 11     | 1   | 1   |
| 10     | 1   | 0   |

note: 11 is in the thirs position because in karnaugh maps we only want to flip 1 bit, and going from 01 to 10 would involve flipping 2 bits

using k-maps:

    - find groups of 1's in the map

        - Groups must be as larage as possible
        - Group size must be a power of 2
        - Contain only ones, no zeros
        - All ones must be in at lease one group
        - Groups can overlap
        - Group's must be rectangles
        - Groups may wrap around the border

| XY \ Z | 0   | 1   |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| 00     | 0   | 0   |
| 01     | 1   | 1   |
| 11     | 1   | 1   |
| 10     | 1   | 0   |

in this example, we can see that we have one group contaning 1's from 11/0 and 10/0

this gives us the equasion:

```
XY N(Z) + X N(Y) N(Z)

the Y cancels out because it is both positive nad negative

= X N(Z)
```

for the next group containing 1's from 01/0, 01/1, 11/0, 11/1

this gives us:

```
N(X) Y N(Z) + N(X) YZ + XY N(Z) + XYZ

simplified and through canceling out we get:

= Y
```

from these two we can get the equasion of the function because to get 1, we either have to have X N(Z) or Y.

F(X,Y,Z) = X N(Z) + Y
