# Iteration

**iterators** are one of the most powerful tools in programming

**iterables** are objects that can be iterated upon, meaning that contain a set of countable values that can be traversed in order

lists, strings, tuples and dictionaries are all examples of iterable python objects.

## the for loop

allows you too

- iterate through each element of a list or tuples
- iterate through each character of a string
- iterate through each key and its associated value in a dictionary

### loops variables

```python

#hard coding

print('zuri').count('e')
print('zoe').count('e')
print('lee').count('e')

# with the implementation of the for loop it becomes two lines of code instead of hard coding

for name in ['zuri', 'joe', 'lee']:
    print(name.count('e'))

#other examples of the for loop include

for idx in range(4):
    square = idx*idx
    print(square)

```

another example for the for loop include repeating simple task with diffrent outcomes

```python

for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
    print("Hi", name, "Please come to my party on Saturday!")

```

in this example **name** is called the loop variable or alternatively **iterator variable**
the list of names in the square brackets is the sequence over which we will iterate

the general syntax for 'for loops' is:

```python

for <loop_var_name> in <sequence>:

```

### flow of execution of the for loop

```python

for <loop_var_name> in <sequence>: #have all items had their turn?
    <statment> #if no assign next item to loop variable and execute all statements in th loop vody

#if yes, read next line

```

### strings and for loops

### lists and for loops

examples:

```python

#this will print a list of each fruit within the value of fruits

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:     # by item
    print(fruit)

#using the range function we can repeat a loop for a set amunt of times

print("This will execute first")

for _ in range(3): #instead of 'range 3' we could of writen 'range [0, 1, 2]'
    print("This line will execute three times")
    print("This line will also execute three times")

print("Now we are outside of the for loop!")

# the loop variable '_' is bound to 0 for the first times line 4 and 5 execute

```

coding problem

```python

#these are all the same thing, or atleast will get the same answer
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print("hello")
    i += 1
#this staes that as long as 1 is below 6 then 'hello' will be printed

for n in range(5):
    print("hello")
#the 'range(x)' counts from 0 up to but not including 'x' so 'hello' will be printed 5 times

hi = "hello"
for c in hi:
    print(hi)
#there are 5 characters in hello so 'hello' will be printed 5 times for every character in hello print 'hello'

```

### accumulating values

has three steps

- **initializing** an 'accumulator' variable to an initial value (such as 0 if accumulating a sum)
- **interating** (e.g traversing the items in a sequence)
- **updating** the accumulator variable on each Iteration

for example:

```python

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
accum = 0
for w in nums: # 'w' has the current item
    accum = accum + w
print(accum)

#where the accumulated value is '55'

```

this is commonly known as a accumulator pattern

and example of the use of 'range'

```python

# 1
print("range(5): ")
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# 2
print("range(0,5): ")
for i in range(0, 5):
    print(i)

# '1' and '2' will print the same thing

# Notice the casting of `range` to the `list`
print(list(range(5))) # 3
print(list(range(0,5))) # 4

# '3' and '4' will print the same thing

print(range(5))

```

and here's an example of using range with accumulation:

```python

accum = 0
for w in range(11):
    accum = accum + w
print(accum)

# or, if you use two inputs for the range function

sec_accum = 0
for w in range(1,11):
    sec_accum = sec_accum + w
print(sec_accum)

```

we can also use loops for counting how many values are in a list:

```python

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
count = 0
for w in nums:
    count = count + 1
print(count)

# in this example we dont make use of w but instead for every change in w we add 1 to the total count

```

## coding challanges

```python

numbers = range(53)
print(list(numbers))

```

## coding challanges 2

```python

str1 = "I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living."
total_characters = 0
for c in str1:
    total_characters += 1

print(total_characters)

```

## coding challange 3

```python

numbers = range(41)
sum1 = 0
for n in numbers:
    sum1 = sum1 + n

print(sum1)

```

### traversal and the for loop: By index

```python

fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']
for n in range(5):
    print(n, fruits[n])

```

considering this list we have each fruit at a certain position, 'apple' is at position 0, 'pear' at 1 and so on.
from this we can iterate through the indexes by geenrating a sequence using teh range function

example problem:

```python

s = "python"
for idx in range(len(s)):
   print(s[idx % 2])

```

in this problem, everytime idx is even we get a 0 becuase there are no lefovers and so it print the character at position 0 which is 'p'

## extra tips with debugging for loops

### printing intermediate results

when values are unknown the best thing to add are print statments to keep track of each changing value

example:

```python

w = range(10)

tot = 0
print("***** Before the For Loop ******")
for num in w:
    print("***** A New Loop Iteration ******")
    print("Value of num:", num)
    tot += num
    print("Value of tot:", tot)
print("***** End of For Loop *****")
print("Final total:", tot)

```

### naming variables in for loops

using singular nouns

example:

```python

genres = ['horror', 'action', 'drama', 'comedy', 'romance', 'documentary']

for genre in genres: # 'genre' is the iterator variable and 'genres' is the sequence variable
    print(genre)

```

the general syntax for 'for loops' is

```python

for iter_var_name in some_seq:
    # code block line 1
    # code block line 2
    # ...

```

after the word in there can be any python expression that evaluates to a sequence

### structure of for loops

the iterable appears after the 'in' keyword

the iterable variable appears after the 'for'

## strings, Lists and tuples

strings are defined as sequential collections of characters, this means that the characters that make up a list are in a certain order

a list is a sequential collection of python data values where each value is defined as an index.
the values that mkae up a list are called elements. list are similar to stings except the elements of a list can have an type and for any one list, the items can be diffrent types

### tuples

is a sequence of items of any type

a tuples is represented by parentheses instead of squre brackets

the key diffrence between tuples and list is that tuples are immutable, meaning that its content cant be changed after the tuple is created.

exmples tuple:

```python

t = (5,)
print(type(t)) # tuple

x = (5)
print(type(x)) # interger or 'int'

```

## index operator: working with the characters of a string

the indexing operator, defined by square brackets [], is used to single out a character or element at the specified position

from left to right the positions are a so[0, x] from right to left the positions are as so [x - -1]

```python

school = "Luther College"
m = school[2] #the statment school[2] selects the character at index  2
print(m)

lastchar = school[-1]
print(lastchar)

```

genereally the 'n'th charcter is a the index 'n-1'

examples of indexing operators used on list:

```python

numbers = [17, 123, 87, 34, 66, 8398, 44]
print(numbers[2])
print(numbers[9-8])
print(numbers[-2])

prices = (1.99, 2.00, 5.50, 20.95, 100.98)
print(prices[0])
print(prices[-1])
print(prices[3-5])

```

## disambiguating []: creation vs indexing

indexing vs creation:

```python

new_lst = [] #creation

new_lst = ["NFLX", "AMZN", "GOOGL", "DIS", "XOM"]
part_of_new_lst = new_lst[0] #indexing

lst = [0]
n_lst = lst[0]

print(lst)
print(type(lst)) #'list'
print(n_lst)
print(type(n_lst)) #'int'

```

### length

returns the number of characters in a string with the **len** function

```python

fruit = "Banana"
print(len(fruit))

#to get the last character of the string

fruit = "Banana"
sz = len(fruit)
lastch = fruit[sz-1]
print(lastch)

#typically this would be combined into a single line

lastch = fruit[len(fruit)-1]

#to get the middle character of a sting we might use

fruit = "grape"
midchar = fruit[len(fruit)//2]
# the value of midchar is "a"
```

**len** will only give the amount of character of the top most value

```python

alist =  ["hello", 2.0, 5]
print(len(alist)) # '4'
print(len(alist[0])) # 'hello'

```

### the slice operator

the **slice** operator **[n:m]** returns the part of the string starting with the character at index 'n' and ending with the character at index 'm'

Example:

```python

singers = "Peter, Paul, and Mary"
print(singers[0:5])
print(singers[7:11])
print(singers[17:21])

fruit = "banana"
print(fruit[:3])
print(fruit[3:])

# if the 'n' value is omitted then the slicing will begin at the start and vice versa for the 'm' value

```

this is the same for list and tuple slicing:

```python

#list slice

a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
print(a_list[1:3])
print(a_list[:4])
print(a_list[3:])
print(a_list[:])

#tuple slice

julia = ("Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia")
print(julia[2])
print(julia[2:6])

print(len(julia))

julia = julia[:3] + ("Eat Pray Love", 2010) + julia[5:]
print(julia)

```

### concatenation and repetition

```python

fruit = ["apple","orange","banana","cherry"]
print([1,2] + [3,4]) # adds two list together
print(fruit+[6,7,8,9]) # adds number to the list

print([0] * 4) # repeats the list 4 times giving a total number of element to '4'

```

### count and index

count and index are short cuts in python. **count** will collect how many time a certain character or element appears in a string or list

```python

a = "I have had an apple on my desk before!"
print(a.count("e")) # Example of using .count() method on Strings
print(a.count("ha"))

# another example

z = ['atoms', 4, 'neutron', 6, 'proton', 4, 'electron', 4, 'electron', 'atoms']
print(z.count("4"))
print(z.count(4)) # Example of using .count() method on lists
print(z.count("a"))
print(z.count("electron"))

```

index on the other hand collects to index positions of characters and elements

```python

music = "Pull out your music and dancing can begin"
bio = ["Metatarsal", "Metatarsal", "Fibula", [], "Tibia", "Tibia", 43, "Femur", "Occipital", "Metatarsal"]

print(music.index("m"))
print(music.index("your"))

print(bio.index("Metatarsal"))
print(bio.index([]))
print(bio.index(43))

```

### splitting and joining

the **split** method breaks apart a string at blank spaces

```python

song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split()
print(wds)

#and can also be broken at specified characters

song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split('ai')
print(wds)

```

with **join**, you choose a desired seperator string, often called 'glue' and join the list with the glue inbetween

```python

wds = ["red", "blue", "green"]
glue = ';'
s = glue.join(wds)
print(s)
print(wds)

print("***".join(wds))
print("".join(wds))

```

### syntax error

syntax erros occur when there is an issue with a syntax of a line for example strings not being enclosed, missing parenthese or intergers etc..

example:

```python

print("Hello, World!")
print(5 + ) #this will cause a syntax error
print("All finished!")

```

### runtime error

usually indicate something big has gone wrong

they happen after the program has passed the syntax check

examples of runtime error causes:

- Misspelled or incorrectly capitalized variable and function names
- Attempts to perform operations (such as math operations) on data of the wrong type (ex. attempting to subtract two variables that hold string values)
- Dividing by zero
- Attempts to use a type conversion function such as int on a value that can’t be converted to an int

```python

subtotal = input("Enter total before tax:")
tax = 0.08 * subTotal
print("tax on", subtotal, "is:", tax)

#fixed

subtotal = int(input("Enter total before tax:")) #turned the input into a interger instead of a 'str'
tax = 0.08 * subtotal #uncaptilised the 't'
print("tax on", subtotal, "is:", tax)

```

diagnose and repair:

- If the error message mentions SyntaxError, you know that the problem has to do with syntax: the structure of the code, the punctuation, etc.
- If the program runs partway and then crashes, you know the problem is a runtime error. Programs with syntax errors don't execute even one line.

### semantic error

also called a logic error

no error message will run, but the computer will do what you told it to do instead of doing what you meant it to do.

```python

num1 = input('Enter a number:')
num2 = input('Enter another number:')
sum = num1 + num2

print('The sum of', num1, 'and', num2, 'is', sum)

#this code will produce a semantic error becuase the numbers entered are intered as strings instead of intergers

```

### some more errors

**name error** is when u use a name before it has an associated value

**type error** is when u try to combine two types that are incompatible

**value error**
