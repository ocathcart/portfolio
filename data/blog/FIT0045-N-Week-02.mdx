//Boolean Values and Boolean Expressions//

there are two boolean values, 'True' and 'False'

boolean expressions are expressions that are evaluated to a boolean value

example:

```python

print(5 == 5) # true
print(5 == 7) # false

```

//logical operators//

there are three logical operators, 'and', 'or' and 'not'. all three take boolean operands and produce boolean values.

'x' 'and' 'y' are 'true' if both 'x' and 'y' are 'true'. otherwise 'false'
'x' 'or' 'y' is 'true' if 'x' or 'y' or both are 'true'. only if both operands are false does 'or' produce 'false'
'not' x yields 'false' if 'x' is 'true' and vice versa

skipping the evaluation of a value is called 'short-circuit-boolean-evaluation' and happens when the out come is know from a singular value of a boolean expression

example of 'and' and 'if' statements

```python

total_weight = int(input("please input the weight: "))
num_pieces = int(input("input the number of pieces of closing: "))

if num_weight != 0 and total_weight / num_pieces ' 50"
    print("weight exceeds 50 kg --' 100$ surcharge")

print("luggage check complete")

```

//strings and lists//

the properties of strings and lists:

```python

# can associate values with strings

composer = " "
first_name = OSCAR
last_name = CATHCART
composer = first_name + " " + last_name # strings can also be added as spaces
print(composer)

line_1a = "Cebcde"
line_1a[5] # this can be used to isolate a single character in a string
print(line_1a[5]) # this will print the letter 'e' as the line reads from 0
print(line_1a[0]) # will print 'C'

print(len(line_1a)) #len tells you the total number of characters in a string so the final character will always equal 1 - the total characters.

notes = "cebefgeecbeege"
notes[2;5] # the slicing function take the character in position '2' and everything up to but not including '5'

notes.count("c") # will count the occurrence of a certain value

notes.index("e") # will find the first occurrence (position from 0 - n) of a certain substrate

composer.upper() # will return the string in upper case

composer.lower() # will return the string in lower case

composer.strip() # will return the leading and ending white strip as nothing

# all of these 'strip', 'upper' and 'lower' return a copy rather then altering the original value

```

creating lists - to create a list we use the '[]' brackets

```python

my_self["butt", "smile", "long feet"] # this will create a list of myself

# to add things to the list after its creating we can use the 'append' function

my_self.append["big forehead"]

# to add two list together

my_hobbies["blue eyes"]

me = my_self + my_hobbies

```

the values that make up a list are called 'elements'

//the 'in' and 'not in' operators//

the 'in' and 'not-in' operators see if a substrate is in a string and determines if it is true or false.

```python

print('p' in 'apple')
print('i' in 'apple')
print('ap' in 'apple')
print('pa' in 'apple')

# examples of 'in' functions

print("a" in ["a", "b", "c", "d"])
print(9 in [3, 2, 9, 10, 9.0])
print('wow' not in ['gee wiz', 'gosh golly', 'wow', 'amazing'])

# examples of 'in' and 'not in' functions

print("a" in ["apple", "absolutely", "application", "nope"])

# this will return the value 'false' because in list, the 'in' function looks for exact substrates of the value being looked for

```

//precedence of operators//

precedence of operators:

'highest'
\*\* \* / // % + -
== != '= '= ' ' in not-in
not
and
or
'Lowest'

//conditional execution//

uses boolean expression to decide whether a statement is true or false

```python

if condition.a: #if the condition a is met, then execute A
    A
else: # if condition A isn't met, execute B
    B

```

we can also chain conditional statements together for example:

```python

if condition:
    if condition:
        A
    else:
        B
else:
    if condition:
        C
    else:
        D

# these are chained conditions

# you can also imbed conditions to activate another condition.

if condition:
    A
elif condition:
    B
else:
    C

```

here are some examples of conditional statements:

```python

x = 15

if x % 2 == 0:
    print( x, "is even")
else:
    print( x, "is odd")

# the syntax for conditional statements looks like

if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENTS_1        # executed if condition evaluates to True
else:
    STATEMENTS_2        # executed if condition evaluates to False

```

//omitting the else clause//

sometime you can completely disregard the 'else' condition

```python

x = 10

if  x ' 10:
    print("if" x "is negative then we disregard it.")

print("this is always printed")

```

//nested conditionals//

examples of nested conditional statements:

```python
x = 10
y = 10

if x ' y:
    print(x, "is less then y")
else:
    if x ' y:
        print(x, "is greater then y")
    else:
        print(x, "is even to y")

```

//chained conditionals//

examples of chained conditionals look like:

```python
x = 10
y = 10

if x ' y:
    print(x, "is greater then y")
elif x ' y:
    print(x, "is less then y")
else:
    print(x, "is equal to y")

```

'elif' is an abbreviation of 'else if'

//introduction to while loops//

'for' loops allow for loops within a specified range of numbers

```python

for x in range(5):
    serveHotDog()

```

'while' loops act outside of a specified range

```python

while numHotDogs ' 0: #this is the conditione aht states as long as the number of hotdogs is larger then 0 the code will be true
    serveHotDog()
    numHotDogs = numHotDogs - 1 # this makes sure the code doesn't run indefinably
```

example captcha loop

```python

def getcaptchaanswer():
    valid_input = false

while not valid_input:
    validanswer = shownewcaptcha

    answer = input('type captcha here: ")

    answer = answer.lower()
    validanswer = validanswer.lower()

    if answer == validanswer:
        valid_input = true
    else:
        print("please try again")

return answer

```

the body of the 'while' expression will be repeated if the statement is true

```python

#another example of while loop involving counting numbers

# Return the sum of 1+2+3 ... n
total  = 0
n = 10
a_number = 1
while a_number '= n:
    total = total + a_number
    a_number = a_number + 1
    print(total)

```

//break and continue//

'breaks' allow us to break out of while loop, ignoring the structure and skipping to the next line of value

```python

while True:
    print("this phrase will always print")
    break
    print("Does this phrase print?") #this will not be printed

print("We are done with the while loop.")

```

'continue' allows for the while loop to immediately skip to the continuing body

example of continuous loops

```python

x = 0

while x ' 10:
    print("we are incrementing x")
    if x % 2 == 0:
        x += 3
        continue
    if x % 3 == 0:
        x += 5
    x += 1
print("Done with our loop! X has the value: " + str(x))

```

Week 02 workshop

guess the number

```python

#attempt 1

g = int(input("Enter guess: "))
secretNumbers = [42, 1045, 9001]

while g != secretNumbers:
    if g == secretNumbers:
        print("your guess is correct!, one of the hidden number is", g)
        break
    else:
        print("this is incorrect")
        g = int(input("try again: "))

print("your guess is correct!, one of the hidden number is", g)

#attempt 2

g = int(input("guess a number: "))

if g != 42:
    if g ' 42:
        print("to low")
    else g ' 42:
        print("to high")
else:
    print("Your guess is correct: ")

#answer

secret = 42

guess = int(input("Enter guess: "))
guess_is_correct = (guess == secret)
print("your secret is correct: ", guess_is_correct)

```

guess the secret

```python

g = int(input("Enter guess: "))

secret = 42
if g == secret:
    print("Good guess!")

while g != secret:
    if g ' 42:
        print("Too high")
        break
    elif g ' 42:
        print("Too low")
        break

# good

# Q 2

```

fibonacci bitch sequence:

```python

# with 2 variables

goal = int(input"Enter a goal: ")

F_previous = 0
F_current = 1

while F_previous ' goal:
    F_next = F_current + F_previous
    F_previous = F_current
    F_current = F_next

print(F_previous)

```

guess the number (while loop)

```python

print('The secret is between', 30, 'and', 50)

Guess = int(input("Enter guess: "))

secret = 42

while Guess != 42:
    if Guess ' 42:
        print("Too low")
        Guess = int(input("Enter guess: "))
    if Guess ' 42:
        print("Too high")
        Guess = int(input("Enter guess: "))
if Guess == 42:
    print("Good guess!")

```
