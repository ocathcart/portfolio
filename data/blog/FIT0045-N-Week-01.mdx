# Introduction

Values are fundamental to programming, they consist of words and numbers that the program manipulates.

in

```python

print("hello, world ")

# The value is "hello world"

```

These objects are classified into different classes, where numbers are integers and world enclosed by quotation marks are strings.

In programs we can specify values by typing them in literally. we can specify words or letter by enclosing them in quotation marks or numbers by typing them in exactly.

we can internal representations of literals 'objects ' or 'values '.

this internal representation is created when the program is executed

you can't directly view the internal representations however you can see the printed representation using the 'print ' function

```python

print(3.2)
print("hello world ")

# the string is enclosed by quotation marks.
# the quotation marks are omitted in the print.
# the number is directly printed.

```

## //Operators and Operands//

u can build complex expressions out simpler ones using operators. 'operators ' are special tokens that represent computations like addition, multiplication and division. The values the operator works on is called the operand.

some tokens include

```python

20 + 32
5 ** 2
(5 + 9) * (15 - 7)
5 / 5

# the +, -, and () mean the same things they do in maths
# the (*) means multiplication
# the ** token is for exponentiation
# the / token means divide
# all of these token behave as they would in normal maths

# No computations above will be printed as the print function is missing

print(7 + 5)

# this will be printed as

12

#--------------------------------------------------------------

print(9 / 5)
print(5 / 9)
print(9 // 5)

# the / will always print integers with a decimal point
# the // function will print integers as integers

#---------------------------------------------------------------

print(7 // 3)
print(7 % 3)

# the % function is called the modulus operator
# % returns the remainder of an object divided by a number

print(10 // 4)

2

# So there is a remainder of 2 left because 2 sets have been made by 4 totalling 8

print(10 % 4)

2

```

The modulus operator allows you to see if a number is divisible by another.

## //function calls//

functions are like factories that take in material, do a operations, and then send out the resulting object.

the material is also referred to as 'arguments ' or 'inputs ' and the resulting object is known as the 'output ' or 'resulting-value '.

input and output values

```python

def square(x):
    return x * x

print(square(5))
# in the above example we have the function square which takes a single input and returns that input multiplied by itself

def sub(x,y):
    return x - y

print(sub(6,7))
# in this example the sub function takes two inputs and returns them as the second input subtracted from the first input.
#the order of inputs matters as it determines how it is read.

```

### //function calls as part of complex expressions//

anywhere you can write a literal you can also write a function to invoke a output value.

```python

def square(x):
    return x * x

def sub(x,y):
    return x - y

print(square(3) + 2)
print(sub(square(3), square(1 + 1)))

```

### //functions are objects; parentheses invoke functions//

don't fuck with parentheses because then you have sad function like sad cherru.

## //Data type//

to understand what type of data or class a clue falls into we can write:

```python

print(type("Hello,world "))
print(type(17))
print(type(3.2))
# each of these, rather then having an output value with produce a sentence like  'class 'str' ' representing "hello, world " as a string
# for 17 it will be  'class'int' ' for integer
# for 3.2 it will be  'class  'float' '

```

if strings are enclosed by quotation marks, single or double, then they are classified as strings

```python

print(type("17"))
print(type("3,2"))
# both of these numbers will be classified as strings  'class 'str' '

```

quotation marks can contain different multiple strings inside them:

```python

print('''"oh no", she exclaimed, "ben's bike is broken "''')
# the out put wil be "oh no, she exclaimed, "ben's bike has been broke "

# another example is:

print("""this message will span
several lines
of the text.""")

#this would look like

# this message will span
# several lines
# in the text.

# obviously without the hashtags

```

commas contained within integers, which would normally be viewed as a separation between digits, acts as a break separating two integers.

```python

print(42500)
# the output will be 42500

print (42,500)
#the output will be 42 500 as separate integers

```

## //type conversion functions//

you can convert different types of values into others with function's called 'type-conversion '

```python

# turning a float value into a inter involves the 'int' function

print(3.14, int(3.14))
# the output being '3,14' and '3'

print(3.99999, int(3.99999))
# the output being '3.99999', and '3'.
# note that it bring the number closer to 0 rather then rounding to the closest integer.

print(float(3), 3)
#this will print the integer '3' and the float '3'

print(str(3), 3)
#this will print the string '3' and integer '3'

```

type-conversion: 'int'

type-conversion: 'float'

type-conversion: 'str'

each of these 'type-conversions ' converts an integer, float, or string into a syntactically legal string, float or integer

## //variables//

variables are given to recurring objects symbolized by the token '='

you can assign different things tro variables such as:

```python

frogs = 4

# when 'frogs' its typed it will produce 4

print(frogs)
    4

# if i want to increase the value of the variable i can make it add or subtract a value

frogs += 1

print(frogs)
    5

frogs -=2

print(frogs)
    3

#each of these allows us to increment our variable

```

the 'type ' of a current value ofa variable will be express3ed as the variable associated with the value.

```python

frogs = 4

print(type(frogs))
#this will be expressed as  'class 'int' '

```

when printing associated values, it will print the most resent variable associated with the value.

```python

day = thursday
day = 32.5
day =19
print(day)
#the product will be 19 because it is the most recent variable associated with 'day'

```

## //variable names and keywords//

when naming variables, lower case and upper case mean different things and we never use spaces. Numbers and underscores can be used.

some variable names (values) are unusable because they are already associated with a certain variable.

list of python keywords:
and
as
assert
break
class
continue
def
del
elif
else
except
exec
finally
for
from
global
if
input
in
is
lambda
nonlocal
not
or
pass
raise
return
try
while
with
yield
true
false
none

## //choosing the right variable name//

choose variable names that have meaning to human readers and will make the program easier to read.

## //statements and expressions//

a 'statement ' is an instruction that the python interpreter can execute

an 'expression ' is a combination of literals, variable names, operators and calls to functions. the result of evaluating an expression is a value or object

interpreters evaluate a expression and displays the result

```python

print(1 + 1 + (2 *3))
print(len("hello"))
#in this example 'len' is a function that returns the number of characters in a string

```

//order of operations//

the order that programming follows is the same at mathematics

1. parentheses

2. exponentiation - this also has a exception to the rules where code will be read right to left when there are two exponentiation

3. multiplication

4. operators

### //reassignment//

order matters

## //updating variables//

you can update values for example

```python

x = 6
print(x)
# this will print '6'
x = x + 1
print(x)
# this will print 7

```

updating a variable by adding something is called an 'increment ', subtracting is called a 'decrement '

for 'increments ' and 'decrements ' there are syntax for them in python '+=' for increment, '-=' for decrement

### //Hard Coding//

Don't do it

## //input//

example '-' allows for interactive code that assigns present values

```python

n = input("please print your name: ")
print("hello", n)

#this will print 'hello  'the value associated with n ''

```

# //Week 01 Workshop//

being concise

example:

```python

age = int(input("input your age: "))
age = age + 1
print("you will turn", age, "this or next year")

# by defining age outside of the print function we make it easier to reuse age outside of the print.

age = int(input("input your age: "))
print("you will turn", age + 1, "this or next year")

#if i printed age again in the program it would be the number i input

```

## Average_mark_activity

```python

x = int(input("Enter your first mark: "))
y = int(input("Enter your second mark: "))
z = ((x + y) // 2)
print("Your unit mark is", int(z))

```

## bit_conversion_activity

```python

str_total_bits = input("Input a number of bits: ")
total_bits = int(str_total_bits)

gigabyte_total = total_bits // (8*1024*1024*1000)
bits_remaining = total_bits % (8*1024*1024*1000)

megabytes_total = total_bits // (8*1024*1024)
bits_remaining = total_bits % (8*1024*1024)

kilobytes_total = bits_remaining // (8*1024)
bits_remaining = total_bits % (8*1024)

bytes_total = bits_remaining // 8
bits_final_remaining = bits_remaining % 8


print(total_bits ,"b", "=", gigabyte_total, "GB", megabytes_total ,"MB", kilobytes_total ,"KB", bytes_total ,"B", bits_final_remaining ,"b")

```

## Fibonacci_sequence_activity

```python

F_num = 0
F_fib0 = 0
F_fib1 = 1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib0)
F_num += 1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib1)

F_num += 1
F_fib2 = F_fib0 + F_fib1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib2)
F_fib0 = F_fib1 #why does switching this and the line below it screw it up entirely
F_fib1 = F_fib2

F_num += 1
F_fib2 = F_fib0 + F_fib1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib2)
F_fib0 = F_fib1
F_fib1 = F_fib2

F_num += 1
F_fib2 = F_fib0 + F_fib1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib2)
F_fib0 = F_fib1
F_fib1 = F_fib2

F_num += 1
F_fib2 = F_fib0 + F_fib1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib2)
F_fib0 = F_fib1
F_fib1 = F_fib2

F_num += 1
F_fib2 = F_fib0 + F_fib1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib2)
F_fib0 = F_fib1
F_fib1 = F_fib2

F_num += 1
F_fib2 = F_fib0 + F_fib1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib2)
F_fib0 = F_fib1
F_fib1 = F_fib2

F_num += 1
F_fib2 = F_fib0 + F_fib1
print("F", F_num, "=", F_fib2)
F_fib0 = F_fib1
F_fib1 = F_fib2

```

## Gigabyte.py

```python

str_total_gigabytes = input("Input a number of gigabytes: ")
total_gigabytes = float(str_total_gigabytes)

total_bits = total_gigabytes * (8*1024*1024*1024)

remain_gigabytes = int(total_bits // (8*1024*1024*1024))
bits_remaining = total_bits % (8*1024*1024*1024)

remain_megabyte = int(bits_remaining // (8*1024*1024))
bits_remaining = total_bits % (8*1024*1024)

remain_kilobyte = int(bits_remaining // (8*1024))
bits_remaining = total_bits % (8*1024)

remain_byte = int(bits_remaining // 8)

print(total_gigabytes,"GB", "=", remain_gigabytes, "GB,", remain_megabyte, "MB,", remain_kilobyte, "KB,", remain_byte, "B")
