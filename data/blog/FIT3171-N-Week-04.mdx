# Normilisation

## INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE Anomalies

- INSERT Anomaly
  - When adding data to a relation you are required to add other (related) data
  - Danger: other data may not be available so cannot proceed with the insert
- UPDATE Anomaly
  - Changing a value for an attribute requires multiple tuples to be changed
  - Danger: only some tuples will be updated leading to inconsistent data
- DELETE Anomaly
  - When a tuple in a relation is deleted, all tuple data is removed
  - Danger: related data, which may be the only such data will be lost

## Data Normalisation

- Relations MUST be normalised in order to avoid anomalies which may
  occur when inserting, updating and deleting data.
- Normalisation is a systematic series of steps for progressively refining the
  data model.
- A formal approach to analysing relations based on their primary key /
  candidate keys and functional dependencies.
- Used:
  - as a design technique "bottom up design", and
  - as a way of validating structures produced via "top down design" (ER model
    converted to a logical model - see next week)
  - for this unit only concerned with conversion to third normal form - higher
    normal forms exist (Boyce Codd Normal Form, fourth normal form â€¦ )

## The Normalisation Process Goals

- Creating valid relations, i.e. each relation meets the properties of the
  relational model. In particular: - Entity integrity - Referential integrity - No many-to-many relationship - Each cell contains a single value (is atomic).
- In practical terms when implemented in an RDBMS:
  - Each table represents a single subject
  - No data item will be unnecessarily stored in more than one table (remember
    some redundancy still exists - minimal redundancy).
  - The relationship between tables can be established (via PK and FK pairs).
  - Each table is void of insert, update and delete anomalies.

## Representing a form as a relation

- This process follows a standard approach:
  - arrive at a name for the form which indicates what it represents (its subject)
  - determine if any attribute is multivalued (repeating) for a given entity
    instance of the forms subject - if an attribute (or set of attributes) appears multiple times then the group
    of related attributes need to be shown enclosed in brackets to indicate
    there are multiple sets of these values for each instance
- Looking at our DRUG data
  - Name: DRUG_SLSREP
    - DRUG_SLSREP (drug_code, drug_name, slsrep_id, slsrep_name,
      slsrep_mobile)
- i.e. the form consists of repeating rows (instances) of drugs assigned to
  sales representatives data
