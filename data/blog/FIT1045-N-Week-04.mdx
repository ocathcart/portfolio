# introduction to functions

**functions** allow you to define and recall a defined value

**functions** are defined as chunks of code that perform some operation that is meangful for a person to thin about as a whole unit

the syntax for creating a named function, a function definition is:

```py

def name( parameters ):
    statement

```

the parameters specify what the function needs to do to work

```py

def hello():
    """This function says hello and greets you"""
    print("Hello")
    print("Glad to meet you")
print(hello())

```

## function invocation

to print or run a function we nee to use **function calls** or **function invocation**

to call a function we refer to it by its name, followed by parentheses

## parameters

example:

```py

def sub(p1, p2):
    total = p1 - p2
    return total

sub(6, 8) # will return -2

```

the parameter list is sometimes reffered to as the **formal parameters** or **parameter names**.

u can assign values to parameters which then produce an output created by what the created function has been programmed to do

## returning a value from a function

functions that return values are called **fruitful function**

a function that doesn't return a value is called a **precedure**

in functions use the **return** functionj to assign a value rather then print a value.

**temporary variable** are also known as **local variables**

### coding challange 1

```py

# your function definition goes here
def subtractThree(n):
    n = int(n)
    return n - 3

# do not modify code below this line
print(subtractThree(input()))

```

### coding challange 2

```py

def intro(name):
    greetingStr = "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I love FIT1045."
    return greetingStr
me = "John wick"
intro(me)

```

### coding chalnnage 3

```py

def decision(string):
    length = len(string)
    if length > 17:
        return "This is a long string"
    elif length < 17:
        return "This is a short string"

sentence = "hello my name is oscar!"
decision(sentence)

```

## Decoding a function

some things to look out for when creating a function:

- How many parameters does it have?

- What is the type of values that will be passed when the function is invoked?

- What is the type of the return value that the function produces when it executes?

so things that can help you figure out the type of object associated with any variable:

- len(x), then x must be a string or a list. (Actually, it can also be a dictionary, in which case it is equivalent to the expression len(x.keys()). Later in the course, we will also see some other sequence types that it could be). x canâ€™t be a number or a Boolean.

- x - y, x and y must be numbers (integer or float)

- x + y, x and y must both be numbers, both be strings, or both be lists

- x[3], x must be a string or a list containing at least four items, or x must be a dictionary that includes 3 as a key.

- x['3'], x must be a dictionary, with '3' as a key.

- x[y:z], x must be a sequence (string or list), and y and z must be integers

- x and y, x and y must be Boolean

- for x in y, y must be a sequence (string or list) or a dictionary (in which case it's really the dictionar's keys); x must be a character if y is a string; if y is a list, x could be of any type.

## type annotations

u can assign a what a value need to be for a function to be carried out with this annotation:

```py

def duplicate(msg: str) -> str:
    """Returns a string containing two copies of `msg`"""

    return msg + msg

result = duplicate('Hello')
print(result)

```

in this example the annotation of 'str' on the 'msg: str' indicates that the caller should pass a sting and produce a string with '-> str'

other examples:

```py

def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Returns the sum of `x` and `y`"""

    return x + y

def get_number(msg: str) -> float:
    """Prompts with `msg` for input; returns numeric response."""

    return float(input(msg))

def display_msg(msg: str):
    """Displays `msg` with dashed line underneath"""

    print(msg)
    print('-------------------------------------')


```

the type annotations have no effect on the programs behavior but instaead act like guide lines as to what value need to be inputed.

## A function that accumulates

defined 'len'

```py

def mylen(seq):
    c = 0 # initialize count variable to 0
    for _ in seq:
        c = c + 1   # increment the counter for each item in seq
    return c

print(mylen("hello"))
print(mylen([1, 2, 7]))

```

### coding challange 5

```py

def total(intList: list):
    accumList = 0
    for numbers in intList:
        accumList = numbers + accumList

    return accumList

total([57, 67, 89])

```

### coding challange 6

```py

def count_even(intList: list):
    evenNumbers = 0
    for number in intList:
        if (number % 2) == 0:
            evenNumbers += 1
        elif (number % 2) != 0:
            evenNumbers += 0
    return evenNumbers

count_even([56, 43, 89, 54, 23])

```

## variables and parameters are local

**built in**, **global** and **local** spaces are the three spaces in which names exist

### global variables

## functions can call other functions

each group of local variables i called a **stack frame**

## dictionaries

dictionaris find keysd and assign values to those keys

one way to create a dictionary to to start wtih an empty {}

to add to this empty dictionary we would write this

```py

eng2sp ={}
eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'
eng2sp['two'] = 'dos'
eng2sp['three'] = 'tres'

```

another way to create a dictionary to to provide a bunch of key-value Paris

```py

eng2sp = {'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos', 'one': 'uno'}

```

how we use dictionaries is as such

```py

eng2sp = {'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos', 'one': 'uno'}

value = eng2sp['two']
print(value)
print(eng2sp['one'])

```

the 'del' function deletes a value from a dictionary or list as thye are both mutable

if the 'len' function is used on a dictionari it will return the number of key-value pairs

values can be eddited by chaging what a certain key is associated with

## dictionary methods

### interrating over dictionaries

if we where to search fro a specific value in a dictionari it would look something like this:

```py

inventory = {'apples': 430, 'bananas': 312, 'pears': 217, 'oranges': 525}

for akey in inventory.keys():     # the order in which we get the keys is not defined
    print("Got key", akey, "which maps to value", inventory[akey])

ks = list(inventory.keys())       # Make a list of all of the keys
print(ks)
print(ks[0])                      # Display the first key

```

methods are a useful tool that can be used with many fucntions and allows for more accessablility within the fucntion

# Week 04 workshop

### understanding fucntions

original:

```py

def my_func(x):
    x = x*x

x = float(input("Input number to square: "))
my_func(x)
print(x)

```

mine:

```py

def my_func(x: float):
    return x * x

x = float(input("Input number to square: "))
print(my_func(x))
print(x)

```
